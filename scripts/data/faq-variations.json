          "answers": {
            "default": "{state} has a {solYears}-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. This means you must file your lawsuit within {solYears} years of the accident date. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be. Evidence preservation is also critical—trucking companies may legally destroy certain records after federal retention periods expire."

          "question": "Can I still recover damages if I was partially at fault for a {city} truck accident?",
          "answers": {
            "pureComparative": "Yes. {state} follows pure comparative negligence, meaning you can recover damages even if you were mostly at fault. Your recovery is reduced by your percentage of fault. For example, if you were 70% at fault and had $100,000 in damages, you could still recover $30,000. However, insurance companies will try to maximize your assigned fault, making experienced legal representation important.",
            "modified50": "Yes, but {state} follows modified comparative negligence with a 50% bar. You can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, but your recovery is reduced by your fault percentage. If you are more than 50% at fault, you cannot recover any damages. This makes establishing the trucking company's primary responsibility critical to your case.",
            "modified51": "Yes, but {state} follows modified comparative negligence with a 51% bar. You can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, with your recovery reduced by your fault percentage. If you are 51% or more at fault, you cannot recover. Insurance companies often try to shift blame to accident victims—experienced attorneys know how to counter these tactics.",
            "contributory": "Unfortunately, {state} follows the harsh contributory negligence rule. If you are found even 1% at fault for the accident, you may be barred from any recovery. This makes legal representation critical in {state} truck accident cases. Your attorney must establish that the trucking company and driver were entirely at fault."

            "default": "Multiple parties may be liable for a {city} truck accident: the truck driver, the trucking company, the vehicle owner (if different), the cargo loading company, the maintenance provider, and potentially the truck or parts manufacturer. Federal regulations make trucking companies responsible for their drivers' conduct while operating company vehicles. An investigation will identify all potentially liable parties to maximize your recovery."

            "default": "After a truck accident in {city}, gather as much evidence as possible: photos of all vehicles and the scene, the truck's DOT number and company information, driver information, witness contact details, and the police report number. Seek immediate medical attention and keep all medical records. Critical truck evidence like electronic logging device data, dash cam footage, and inspection records must be preserved quickly—your attorney can send a spoliation letter requiring the trucking company to preserve this evidence."

          "question": "How long do trucking companies keep records in {state}?",
          "answers": {
            "default": "Federal regulations require trucking companies to retain driver qualification files for three years after employment, hours of service records for six months, vehicle inspection reports for one year, and accident records for three years. However, companies often destroy records as soon as legally permitted. An attorney can send a preservation letter requiring the company to retain all evidence related to your accident."

          "answers": {
            "default": "Commercial trucks contain Electronic Control Modules (ECMs) that record data including speed, braking, engine RPM, and seat belt use before an accident. This 'black box' data is crucial evidence in truck accident cases. However, this data can be overwritten or lost if not preserved quickly. Your attorney should immediately request preservation of ECM data from the trucking company."

          "answers": {
            "default": "Truck accidents in {city} often cause severe injuries due to the massive size difference between commercial trucks and passenger vehicles. Common injuries include traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord damage, multiple fractures, internal organ damage, burns, and wrongful death. Even 'minor' truck accidents frequently cause long-term injuries requiring extensive medical treatment. The {region} region's {regionalFactors} contribute to particularly severe accident types."

          "question": "Should I see a doctor after a truck accident even if I feel fine?",
          "answers": {
            "default": "Yes, absolutely. Many serious injuries from truck accidents don't show immediate symptoms. Traumatic brain injuries, internal bleeding, and soft tissue damage may take days or weeks to manifest. Prompt medical evaluation creates documentation of your injuries and establishes the connection to the accident. Delayed treatment can both harm your health and weaken your legal claim."

          "answers": {
            "default": "{interstate} near {city} sees high truck accident rates due to heavy commercial traffic volume combined with {regionalFactors}. The corridor carries significant freight between major distribution points. Driver fatigue on long hauls, congestion-related rear-end collisions, and weather-related incidents all contribute to accident frequency in this area."

          "answers": {
            "default": "Truck accidents in {city} differ from car accidents in several important ways: commercial trucks can weigh up to 80,000 pounds compared to a 4,000-pound car; trucking companies must follow federal FMCSA regulations; multiple parties may be liable; trucks carry higher insurance coverage; and the injuries are typically more severe. These factors make truck accident cases more complex but also potentially more valuable than typical car accident claims."
