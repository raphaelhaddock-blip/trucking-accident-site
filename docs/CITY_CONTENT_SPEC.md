# City Page Content Specification (3,000+ words)

## Overview

Every city page must be **3,000+ words** of unique, localized content. No two city pages can share identical paragraphs. Generic content that could apply to any city will be rejected.

**The Core Rule:** If you can swap the city name and the content still makes sense, it's not unique enough.

---

## Required Sections

### 1. City History & Trucking Context (300 words)

**Purpose:** Establish local expertise and provide unique historical context.

**MUST include:**
- City founding/incorporation date
- When major highways were built through city (specific years)
- Historical trucking industry development
- Notable historical accidents (if any)
- Economic evolution tied to freight
- Population growth correlated with highway development

**DIFFERENTIATION RULE:** Every city has unique history. Reference specific years, local events, industry changes. Newark's port history ≠ Buffalo's rail-to-truck transition ≠ Orlando's tourism-driven growth.

**Example (Newark, NJ):**
> Newark's position as a trucking hub dates to 1915 when the city's port facilities began expanding. The completion of the New Jersey Turnpike in 1951 transformed Newark into a critical interchange point, with Exit 14 becoming one of the busiest truck exits in America. The 1962 opening of the Elizabeth-Port Authority Marine Terminal cemented the region's dominance in East Coast freight distribution.

**NOT Acceptable:**
> "This city has a long history of trucking activity. Major highways were built through the area, increasing truck traffic over the years."

---

### 2. Local Crash Data (400 words)

**Purpose:** Establish credibility with specific, verifiable statistics.

**MUST include:**

| Data Point | Source | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| City/county fatality count | FARS database | "27 truck-involved fatalities (2019-2023)" |
| Year-over-year trends | State DOT | "18% increase since 2020" |
| Comparison to state average | Calculated | "2.3x the state average per capita" |
| Most dangerous corridors | Local crash reports | "I-78 at Exit 52: 12 crashes in 2023" |
| Intersection hotspots | Police data | "Routes 1 & 9 junction: 8 truck crashes" |

**DIFFERENTIATION RULE:** Every city has different numbers. Use actual data from:
- FARS (Fatality Analysis Reporting System)
- State DOT crash databases
- Local police department reports
- County traffic safety boards

**Required Format:**

```
### [City] Truck Accident Statistics

**Fatality Data (2019-2023):**
- Total truck-involved fatalities: [X]
- Average per year: [X]
- Trend: [increasing/decreasing] by [X]%

**Crash Hotspots:**
1. [Location]: [X] crashes ([Year])
2. [Location]: [X] crashes ([Year])
3. [Location]: [X] crashes ([Year])

**Comparison:**
- State average: [X] per 100,000 population
- [City] rate: [X] per 100,000 population
- [City] is [X]% [above/below] state average
```

---

### 3. Highway Profiles (500 words × 3-4 highways = 1,500-2,000 words)

**Purpose:** Provide actionable, specific information about local trucking routes.

**For EACH highway through city, MUST include:**

| Element | Requirement | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Full Official Name | Route + local designation | "Interstate 78 (Phillipsburg-Newark Expressway)" |
| City Entry/Exit Points | Mile markers | "Enters city at MM 52, exits at MM 58" |
| Named Interchanges | Exit numbers + destinations | "Exit 54: Garden State Parkway North" |
| Danger Zones | Specific mile markers | "MM 54-56: Weave section, 3 lanes to 2" |
| Local Landmarks | As reference points | "Near Newark Liberty Airport cargo terminals" |
| AADT Truck Count | Specific numbers | "38,000 trucks daily at Exit 14" |
| Recent Crashes | Date + brief description | "October 2023: Jackknife blocked all lanes" |
| Unique Hazards | Specific to this section | "Airport access ramps, low clearance under terminals" |

**DIFFERENTIATION RULE:** No two cities share the same interchanges. Every highway description must name LOCAL features. The I-95 through Newark is completely different from I-95 through Miami.

**Required Format for Each Highway:**

```
### [Highway Name] Through [City]

**Route Profile:**
- Official designation: [Full name]
- Miles through [City]: [X] miles (MM [X] to MM [X])
- Daily truck traffic: [X] trucks (AADT)

**Key Interchanges in [City]:**

**Exit [X] - [Name/Destination]**
- Traffic volume: [X] vehicles daily

- Notable crashes: [Date]: [Brief description]

**Exit [X] - [Name/Destination]**
- Traffic volume: [X] vehicles daily
- Hazards: [Specific issues]
- Notable crashes: [Date]: [Brief description]

**Danger Zones:**

**MM [X]-[X]: [Hazard Name]**
[Detailed description of why this section is dangerous. Include:
- Geometric issues (curves, grades)

- Visibility problems
- Historical crash patterns]

**Recent Incidents:**
- [Date]: [What happened, injuries, cause if known]
- [Date]: [What happened, injuries, cause if known]
```

---

### 4. Localized FAQs (600 words, 6-8 questions)

**Purpose:** Capture long-tail search queries with authoritative local answers.

**Each FAQ MUST reference:**
- Specific courthouse name (e.g., "Essex County Superior Court in Newark")
- Nearest Level 1 trauma center by name
- State statute citations
- County-specific procedures
- Local trucking companies by name (where relevant)
- Jurisdiction-specific settlement examples

**Required FAQ Topics:**

1. **Local Filing:** "Where do I file a truck accident lawsuit in [City]?"
   - Must name specific courthouse and address
   - Include federal court option if applicable

2. **Statute of Limitations:** "What is the deadline to sue after a truck accident in [City]?"
   - State statute citation
   - Any local procedural requirements

3. **Medical Treatment:** "What hospitals treat truck accident victims in [City]?"
   - Name Level 1 trauma centers
   - Include helicopter transport considerations

4. **Local Trucking:** "What trucking companies operate in [City]?"
   - Name actual local carriers
   - Distribution centers

5. **Settlement Timeline:** "How long do truck accident cases take in [County] courts?"
   - Local court processing times
   - Mediation requirements

6. **Average Settlements:** "What is the average truck accident settlement in [City]?"
   - Realistic ranges for this jurisdiction
   - Factors affecting local cases

**DIFFERENTIATION RULE:** FAQs must name local courts, hospitals, and procedures. Generic FAQs = rejection.

**Example (Acceptable):**

```
#### Q: Where do I file a truck accident lawsuit in Newark?

**A:** Truck accident lawsuits in Newark are typically filed in the Essex
County Superior Court, located at 465 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard.
For cases exceeding $150,000 in federal claims, you may also file in the
U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey (Newark Vicinage) at
50 Walnut Street.

**Key Considerations:**
- Essex County uses mandatory arbitration for cases under $50,000
- Complex truck cases are often assigned to the mass tort division
- Federal cases may be faster due to lower caseloads

**Local Resources:**
- Essex County Bar Association Lawyer Referral: (973) 622-6207
```

**Example (NOT Acceptable):**

```
#### Q: Where do I file a truck accident lawsuit?

**A:** You should file in the appropriate court in your area. Contact a
local attorney to learn about your options.
```

| Summer Hazards | Heat-related issues, construction season |
| Fog/Visibility | Specific locations prone to fog |
| Flood Zones | Roads that flood, history |

**DIFFERENTIATION RULE:** NYC weather ≠ Buffalo weather ≠ Syracuse weather. Be specific about:

- Annual snowfall (NYC: 30" vs Buffalo: 95")
- Microclimates (lake effect, urban heat island)

**Example (Buffalo):**

```
### Weather Hazards for Trucking in Buffalo

**Lake Effect Snow**
Buffalo averages 95 inches of snow annually, with lake effect events
capable of dropping 2-3 feet in 24 hours. The I-90 corridor south of
the city (MM 55-65) is particularly vulnerable when northwest winds
blow across Lake Erie.

**Critical Dates:**
- First measurable snow: Average October 28
- Lake effect season: November through January
- Last freeze: Average May 5

**High-Risk Locations:**
- I-90 Southtowns (MM 55-62): Direct lake effect exposure
- Route 219 at Boston Hills: Elevation change + snow accumulation

**Example (Edison, NJ):**

```
### Why Trucks Are Everywhere in Edison

Edison sits at the intersection of I-287 and the New Jersey Turnpike,
making it a logistics hub for the entire Northeast.

**Major Distribution Centers:**
- **Amazon EWR9** (1 Applegate Drive): 1.2M sq ft, 500+ trucks daily

- Penske Logistics (Edison terminal)
- XPO Logistics (cross-dock facility)

**What's Being Moved:**
- Consumer goods from Amazon, Target, Walmart DCs
- Pharmaceutical products from nearby J&J, Merck facilities
- Food products from ShopRite, Wakefern distribution
- Construction materials serving NYC metro development
```
