  introduction: `The moments after a collision with an 18-wheeler are terrifying and disorienting. You may be injured, in shock, and unsure what to do next. But the actions you take in the first hours and days after a truck accident can significantly impact your health, your legal rights, and your ability to recover compensation. This comprehensive guide walks you through every critical step you need to take, from the accident scene to contacting legal help. Whether you were hit by a semi-truck, tractor-trailer, or commercial vehicle, these steps apply to you.`,

      heading: 'Step 1: Ensure Safety and Call 911',
      content: `Your first priority is safety. If you can move and it's safe to do so, get yourself and any passengers away from traffic and potential hazards like leaking fuel. Commercial trucks often carry hazardous materials, so be aware of any unusual smells or spills.

Call 911 immediately. Even if you think your injuries are minor, you need:
- Emergency medical services to evaluate everyone involved
- Police to document the scene and file an official report
- Fire department if there's fuel leakage or fire risk

The police report is crucial evidence for your case. It will document the truck driver's information, the trucking company, witness statements, and the officer's observations about fault. Never skip this step, even if the truck driver pressures you to "handle it privately."`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'Step 2: Seek Medical Attention Immediately',
      content: `Get medical treatment right away, even if you feel fine. Truck accident injuries are often more severe than they initially appear due to the massive size and weight difference between commercial trucks and passenger vehicles.

Adrenaline can mask serious injuries for hours or even days. Common delayed-onset injuries include:
- Traumatic brain injuries (TBI)
- Internal bleeding
- Spinal cord damage
- Soft tissue injuries
- Whiplash

Visit the emergency room or urgent care immediately. Tell doctors about EVERY symptom, no matter how minor it seems. This creates a medical record that directly links your injuries to the accident. Insurance companies will use any gap in treatment to argue your injuries aren't serious or weren't caused by the crash.

Follow up with all recommended specialists and attend every appointment. Keep copies of all medical records, bills, and receipts.`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'Step 3: Document Everything at the Scene',
      content: `If you're physically able, gather as much evidence as possible at the accident scene. This evidence can disappear quickly, especially since trucking companies often dispatch rapid response teams to protect their interests.

Take photos and videos of:
- All vehicles involved from multiple angles
- Damage to your vehicle and the truck
- The truck's license plate, DOT number, and company name on the cab
- Skid marks, debris, and road conditions
- Traffic signs, signals, and road markings
- Weather conditions
- Any visible injuries you have

Get contact information from:
- The truck driver (name, phone, license number)
- The trucking company (name, address, insurance info)
- Any witnesses (names, phone numbers, what they saw)

Write down your own account of what happened while it's fresh in your memory. Include details like the time, location, weather, and exactly what you observed before, during, and after the impact.`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'Step 4: Preserve Critical Trucking Evidence',
      content: `Commercial trucks are required to carry specific evidence that can prove fault in your case. However, this evidence can be destroyed or "lost" if you don't act quickly.

Critical evidence includes:
- Electronic Logging Device (ELD) data showing hours of service
- Black box data (speed, braking, steering inputs)
- Driver qualification files
- Drug and alcohol test results (required within 32 hours of a fatal crash)
- Truck maintenance and inspection records
- Cargo loading documentation
- GPS and dispatch records

Under federal law (FMCSA regulations), trucking companies must preserve this evidence after an accident. However, some companies will "accidentally" delete or lose incriminating data. An attorney can send a spoliation letter demanding evidence preservation before it disappears.`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'Step 5: Be Careful What You Say',
      content: `What you say after an accident can be used against you. Insurance companies and trucking company lawyers will look for any statement they can twist to reduce your compensation.

DO NOT:
- Admit fault or apologize (even saying "I'm sorry" can be used against you)
- Give a recorded statement to any insurance company without legal advice
- Sign any documents from the trucking company or their insurer
- Post about the accident on social media
- Discuss the accident details with anyone except your attorney and doctors

When talking to insurance companies, provide only basic facts: your name, contact information, and that an accident occurred. Do not discuss injuries, fault, or settlement. Simply say, "I need to speak with an attorney before providing further information."

The trucking company's insurance adjuster is not on your side. Their job is to minimize what the company pays you, not to help you get fair compensation.`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'Step 6: Contact a Truck Accident Attorney',
      content: `Truck accident cases are far more complex than regular car accidents. They involve federal FMCSA regulations, multiple potentially liable parties, and aggressive corporate defense teams. You need an attorney who specializes in trucking accidents, not just any personal injury lawyer.

A specialized truck accident attorney will:
- Immediately preserve critical evidence before it's destroyed
- Investigate the trucking company's safety record
- Identify all liable parties (driver, trucking company, cargo loader, manufacturer)
- Handle all communication with insurance companies
- Calculate the full value of your damages (current and future)
- Fight to maximize your compensation

Most truck accident attorneys work on contingency, meaning you pay nothing upfront. They only get paid if you win your case. Don't let cost concerns stop you from getting legal help.

Time is critical. Evidence disappears, memories fade, and statutes of limitations apply. The trucking company's lawyers are already working to protect their client. You need someone fighting for you too.`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'Step 7: Keep Detailed Records',
      content: `From the moment of your accident, start a dedicated file for everything related to your case. This organization will help your attorney build the strongest possible claim.

Keep records of:
- All medical treatments, appointments, and prescriptions
- Medical bills and explanation of benefits (EOBs)
- Lost wages documentation (pay stubs, employer letters)
- Out-of-pocket expenses (transportation to appointments, home modifications)
- Pain journal documenting daily symptoms and limitations
- Photos of your injuries as they heal
- All correspondence with insurance companies

Save everything, even if you're not sure it's relevant. Your attorney can determine what's useful for your case.`,

    {
      question: 'How long do I have to file a truck accident lawsuit?',
      answer:
        'Statutes of limitations vary by state, typically ranging from 1-6 years. However, waiting too long allows critical evidence to disappear. Most truck accident attorneys recommend contacting a lawyer within days of your accident to preserve evidence and protect your rights.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Should I accept the insurance company\'s first settlement offer?',
      answer:
        'Almost never. First offers are typically far below the true value of your claim. Insurance companies make low initial offers hoping victims will accept before understanding the full extent of their injuries and damages. An experienced truck accident attorney can evaluate whether an offer is fair.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What if the truck driver says the accident was my fault?',
      answer:
        'Do not accept blame. Truck drivers and their companies often try to shift fault to avoid liability. Evidence like black box data, ELD records, and witness statements often reveal the true cause. Even if you were partially at fault, you may still recover compensation under comparative negligence laws.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I post about my accident on social media?',
      answer:
        'No. Insurance companies and defense attorneys actively search social media for anything they can use against you. Even innocent posts can be taken out of context. Avoid posting anything about the accident, your injuries, or your activities until your case is resolved.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What if I can\'t afford a truck accident attorney?',
      answer:
        'Most truck accident attorneys work on contingency, meaning you pay nothing unless you win. The attorney\'s fee comes from the settlement or verdict, not your pocket. Initial consultations are typically free, so there\'s no risk in speaking with an attorney about your case.',
