  truckingIndustry: `Though smaller than major metros, Oneida sits on key trucking routes in Tennessee. distribution hub volume brings commercial vehicles past residential and commercial areas.

Tennessee commercial trucks carry goods vital to the economy, but this heavy traffic comes with risks. summer thunderstorms can make already-dangerous truck encounters even more hazardous for passenger vehicles.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Oneida are governed by Tennessee state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: Tennessee has a 1-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Modified Comparative Negligence**: Tennessee uses a modified comparative fault system with a 50% bar. You can recover damages if you were 50% or less at fault, but your recovery is reduced by your fault percentage. If you are found more than 50% responsible, you cannot recover any damages.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our Oneida truck accident attorneys understand both Tennessee law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,

      {
          "question": "What is the statute of limitations for truck accident cases in Oneida, Tennessee?",
          "answer": "Tennessee has a 1-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. This means you must file your lawsuit within 1 years of the accident date. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be. Evidence preservation is also critical—trucking companies may legally destroy certain records after federal retention periods expire."
      },
      {
          "question": "Can I still recover damages if I was partially at fault for a Oneida truck accident?",
          "answer": "Yes, but Tennessee follows modified comparative negligence with a 50% bar. You can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, but your recovery is reduced by your fault percentage. If you are more than 50% at fault, you cannot recover any damages. This makes establishing the trucking company's primary responsibility critical to your case."
      },
      {
          "question": "What insurance covers truck accidents in Oneida?",
          "answer": "Multiple insurance policies may cover a Oneida truck accident: the trucking company's liability insurance (federal minimum $750,000-$5 million depending on cargo), the driver's personal insurance, your own uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage, and your health insurance or Med-Pay. An attorney will identify all available coverage sources to maximize your recovery."
      },

      },
      {
          "question": "What are common injuries in Oneida truck accidents?",
          "answer": "Truck accidents in Oneida often cause severe injuries due to the massive size difference between commercial trucks and passenger vehicles. Common injuries include traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord damage, multiple fractures, internal organ damage, burns, and wrongful death. Even 'minor' truck accidents frequently cause long-term injuries requiring extensive medical treatment. The Southeast region's summer thunderstorms and hurricanes contribute to particularly severe accident types."
      },
      {
          "question": "What evidence should I gather after a truck accident in Oneida?",
          "answer": "After a truck accident in Oneida, gather as much evidence as possible: photos of all vehicles and the scene, the truck's DOT number and company information, driver information, witness contact details, and the police report number. Seek immediate medical attention and keep all medical records. Critical truck evidence like electronic logging device data, dash cam footage, and inspection records must be preserved quickly—your attorney can send a spoliation letter requiring the trucking company to preserve this evidence."
