  truckingIndustry: `Though smaller than major metros, Huntingdon sits on key trucking routes in Tennessee. distribution hub volume brings commercial vehicles past residential and commercial areas.

Tennessee commercial trucks carry goods vital to the economy, but this heavy traffic comes with risks. summer thunderstorms can make already-dangerous truck encounters even more hazardous for passenger vehicles.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Huntingdon are governed by Tennessee state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: Tennessee has a 1-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Modified Comparative Negligence**: Tennessee uses a modified comparative fault system with a 50% bar. You can recover damages if you were 50% or less at fault, but your recovery is reduced by your fault percentage. If you are found more than 50% responsible, you cannot recover any damages.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our Huntingdon truck accident attorneys understand both Tennessee law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,

          "question": "What is the statute of limitations for truck accident cases in Huntingdon, Tennessee?",
          "answer": "Tennessee has a 1-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. This means you must file your lawsuit within 1 years of the accident date. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be. Evidence preservation is also critical—trucking companies may legally destroy certain records after federal retention periods expire."

      {
          "question": "Can I still recover damages if I was partially at fault for a Huntingdon truck accident?",
          "answer": "Yes, but Tennessee follows modified comparative negligence with a 50% bar. You can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, but your recovery is reduced by your fault percentage. If you are more than 50% at fault, you cannot recover any damages. This makes establishing the trucking company's primary responsibility critical to your case."

An attorney will identify all available coverage sources to maximize your recovery."

This arrangement allows accident victims to access quality legal representation regardless of their financial situation. You should also understand what case costs are covered."
      },
      {
          "question": "What evidence should I gather after a truck accident in Huntingdon?",
          "answer": "After a truck accident in Huntingdon, gather as much evidence as possible: photos of all vehicles and the scene, the truck's DOT number and company information, driver information, witness contact details, and the police report number. Seek immediate medical attention and keep all medical records.
