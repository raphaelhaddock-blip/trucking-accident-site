  truckingIndustry: `Truck traffic in Lithia Springs stems largely from distribution hub volume passing through on I-75. Local residents share roads with these large commercial vehicles.

The Georgia trucking industry employs thousands of drivers who transport goods across the state. However, factors including summer thunderstorms, hurricanes create hazardous conditions. When tired or negligent drivers operate 80,000-pound vehicles in these conditions, catastrophic accidents result.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Lithia Springs are governed by Georgia state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: Georgia has a 2-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Modified Comparative Negligence**: Georgia uses a modified comparative fault system with a 50% bar. You can recover damages if you were 50% or less at fault, but your recovery is reduced by your fault percentage. If you are found more than 50% responsible, you cannot recover any damages.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our Lithia Springs truck accident attorneys understand both Georgia law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,

  faqs: [
      {
          "question": "What compensation can I expect from a Lithia Springs 18-wheeler accident?",
          "answer": "Compensation from an 18-wheeler accident in Lithia Springs typically includes economic damages (medical bills, lost wages, future medical care, property damage) and non-economic damages (pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life). Commercial trucks carry higher insurance minimums than passenger vehicles, often providing greater recovery potential. Georgia's modified-50 system affects how compensation is calculated based on fault allocation."
      },
      {
          "question": "How long does a truck accident case take in Lithia Springs?",
          "answer": "Truck accident cases in Lithia Springs generally take between one and three years to resolve. Timeline depends on injury severity, complexity of liability issues, and whether the case settles or goes to trial. Cases involving multiple defendants or catastrophic injuries typically take longer. Your attorney will work to resolve your case efficiently while maximizing your recovery."
      },
      {
          "question": "Can I still recover damages if I was partially at fault for a Lithia Springs truck accident?",
          "answer": "Yes, but Georgia follows modified comparative negligence with a 50% bar. You can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, but your recovery is reduced by your fault percentage. If you are more than 50% at fault, you cannot recover any damages. This makes establishing the trucking company's primary responsibility critical to your case."
      },
      {
          "question": "How much does a truck accident lawyer in Lithia Springs cost?",
          "answer": "Most truck accident lawyers in Lithia Springs work on a contingency fee basis—you pay nothing upfront and no attorney fees unless you win. The attorney fee is typically a percentage of your recovery, usually 33-40% depending on whether the case settles or goes to trial. This arrangement allows accident victims to access quality legal representation regardless of their financial situation. You should also understand what case costs are covered."
      },
      {
          "question": "What happens after I hire a Lithia Springs truck accident lawyer?",
          "answer": "After hiring a truck accident lawyer in Lithia Springs, your attorney will: send preservation letters to protect evidence, investigate the accident scene and trucking company records, gather medical records and bills, identify all liable parties and insurance coverage, calculate your damages, negotiate with insurance companies, and file a lawsuit if necessary. Most cases settle without trial, but your attorney should be prepared to try your case if needed."
      },
      {
          "question": "What are common injuries in Lithia Springs truck accidents?",
          "answer": "Truck accidents in Lithia Springs often cause severe injuries due to the massive size difference between commercial trucks and passenger vehicles. Common injuries include traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord damage, multiple fractures, internal organ damage, burns, and wrongful death. Even 'minor' truck accidents frequently cause long-term injuries requiring extensive medical treatment. The Southeast region's summer thunderstorms and hurricanes contribute to particularly severe accident types."
      },
      {
          "question": "What evidence should I gather after a truck accident in Lithia Springs?",
          "answer": "After a truck accident in Lithia Springs, gather as much evidence as possible: photos of all vehicles and the scene, the truck's DOT number and company information, driver information, witness contact details, and the police report number. Seek immediate medical attention and keep all medical records. Critical truck evidence like electronic logging device data, dash cam footage, and inspection records must be preserved quickly—your attorney can send a spoliation letter requiring the trucking company to preserve this evidence."
