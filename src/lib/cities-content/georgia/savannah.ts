  truckingIndustry: `Savannah's growing economy benefits from its trucking connections, but I-75 traffic also brings risk. distribution hub volume depends on this transportation corridor.

The Georgia trucking industry employs thousands of drivers who transport goods across the state. However, factors including summer thunderstorms, hurricanes create hazardous conditions. When tired or negligent drivers operate 80,000-pound vehicles in these conditions, catastrophic accidents result.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Savannah are governed by Georgia state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: Georgia has a 2-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Modified Comparative Negligence**: Georgia uses a modified comparative fault system with a 50% bar. You can recover damages if you were 50% or less at fault, but your recovery is reduced by your fault percentage. If you are found more than 50% responsible, you cannot recover any damages.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our Savannah truck accident attorneys understand both Georgia law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,

  faqs: [
      {
          "question": "What compensation can I expect from a Savannah 18-wheeler accident?",
          "answer": "Compensation from an 18-wheeler accident in Savannah typically includes economic damages (medical bills, lost wages, future medical care, property damage) and non-economic damages (pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life). Commercial trucks carry higher insurance minimums than passenger vehicles, often providing greater recovery potential. Georgia's modified-50 system affects how compensation is calculated based on fault allocation."
      },
      {
          "question": "How long does a truck accident case take in Savannah?",
          "answer": "Truck accident cases in Savannah generally take between one and three years to resolve. Timeline depends on injury severity, complexity of liability issues, and whether the case settles or goes to trial. Cases involving multiple defendants or catastrophic injuries typically take longer. Your attorney will work to resolve your case efficiently while maximizing your recovery."
      },
      {
          "question": "Can I still recover damages if I was partially at fault for a Savannah truck accident?",
          "answer": "Yes, but Georgia follows modified comparative negligence with a 50% bar. You can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, but your recovery is reduced by your fault percentage. If you are more than 50% at fault, you cannot recover any damages. This makes establishing the trucking company's primary responsibility critical to your case."
      },
      {
          "question": "What evidence should I gather after a truck accident in Savannah?",
          "answer": "After a truck accident in Savannah, gather as much evidence as possible: photos of all vehicles and the scene, the truck's DOT number and company information, driver information, witness contact details, and the police report number. Seek immediate medical attention and keep all medical records. Critical truck evidence like electronic logging device data, dash cam footage, and inspection records must be preserved quickly—your attorney can send a spoliation letter requiring the trucking company to preserve this evidence."
      },
      {
          "question": "What happens after I hire a Savannah truck accident lawyer?",
          "answer": "After hiring a truck accident lawyer in Savannah, your attorney will: send preservation letters to protect evidence, investigate the accident scene and trucking company records, gather medical records and bills, identify all liable parties and insurance coverage, calculate your damages, negotiate with insurance companies, and file a lawsuit if necessary. Most cases settle without trial, but your attorney should be prepared to try your case if needed."
      },
      {
          "question": "Why do I need a truck accident lawyer in Savannah?",
          "answer": "Truck accident cases require attorneys who understand both federal trucking regulations and Georgia law. Trucking companies have experienced legal teams and insurers who begin building their defense immediately after an accident. A qualified truck accident lawyer knows how to preserve critical evidence, investigate regulatory violations, identify all liable parties, and negotiate with commercial insurers."
      },
      {
          "question": "What are common injuries in Savannah truck accidents?",
          "answer": "Truck accidents in Savannah often cause severe injuries due to the massive size difference between commercial trucks and passenger vehicles. Common injuries include traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord damage, multiple fractures, internal organ damage, burns, and wrongful death. Even 'minor' truck accidents frequently cause long-term injuries requiring extensive medical treatment. The Southeast region's summer thunderstorms and hurricanes contribute to particularly severe accident types."
