  truckingIndustry: `Though smaller than major metros, Other sits on key trucking routes in Georgia. distribution hub volume brings commercial vehicles past residential and commercial areas.

Georgia commercial trucks carry goods vital to the economy, but this heavy traffic comes with risks. summer thunderstorms can make already-dangerous truck encounters even more hazardous for passenger vehicles.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Other are governed by Georgia state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: Georgia has a 2-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Modified Comparative Negligence**: Georgia uses a modified comparative fault system with a 50% bar. You can recover damages if you were 50% or less at fault, but your recovery is reduced by your fault percentage. If you are found more than 50% responsible, you cannot recover any damages.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our Other truck accident attorneys understand both Georgia law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,

          "question": "What is the statute of limitations for truck accident cases in Other, Georgia?",
          "answer": "Georgia has a 2-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. This means you must file your lawsuit within 2 years of the accident date.

Evidence preservation is also critical—trucking companies may legally destroy certain records after federal retention periods expire."

You can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, but your recovery is reduced by your fault percentage. If you are more than 50% at fault, you cannot recover any damages. This makes establishing the trucking company's primary responsibility critical to your case."
