  truckingIndustry: `Pocahontas's location along I-40 means steady commercial truck traffic despite the city's size. oil field hauling keeps 18-wheelers moving through day and night.

The Arkansas trucking industry employs thousands of drivers who transport goods across the state. However, factors including extreme heat, sudden thunderstorms create hazardous conditions. When tired or negligent drivers operate 80,000-pound vehicles in these conditions, catastrophic accidents result.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Pocahontas are governed by Arkansas state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: Arkansas has a 3-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Modified Comparative Negligence**: Arkansas uses a modified comparative fault system with a 50% bar. You can recover damages if you were 50% or less at fault, but your recovery is reduced by your fault percentage. If you are found more than 50% responsible, you cannot recover any damages.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our Pocahontas truck accident attorneys understand both Arkansas law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,

      {
          "question": "What's the average settlement for Pocahontas truck crashes?",
          "answer": "Truck accident settlements in rural areas like Pocahontas can be substantial despite lower population density. The South Central region's unique trucking hazards—extreme heat and sudden thunderstorms—often contribute to severe accidents. While average settlements are difficult to calculate, serious truck accident cases regularly result in six and seven-figure recoveries."
      },
      {
          "question": "How long do I have to file a truck accident lawsuit in Arkansas?",
          "answer": "You have 3 years from the accident date to file a truck accident lawsuit in Arkansas. However, waiting too long can hurt your case even within this timeframe.

You can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, but your recovery is reduced by your fault percentage. If you are more than 50% at fault, you cannot recover any damages. This makes establishing the trucking company's primary responsibility critical to your case."
