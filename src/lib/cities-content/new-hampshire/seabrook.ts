  truckingIndustry: `Truck traffic in Seabrook stems largely from urban congestion passing through on I-93. Local residents share roads with these large commercial vehicles.

The New Hampshire trucking industry employs thousands of drivers who transport goods across the state. However, factors including winter ice, black ice create hazardous conditions. When tired or negligent drivers operate 80,000-pound vehicles in these conditions, catastrophic accidents result.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Seabrook are governed by New Hampshire state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: New Hampshire has a 3-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Modified Comparative Negligence**: New Hampshire follows modified comparative negligence with a 51% bar. You can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, with your compensation reduced by your fault percentage. If you are 51% or more at fault, you are barred from recovery.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our Seabrook truck accident attorneys understand both New Hampshire law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,

  faqs: [
      {
          "question": "What compensation can I expect from a Seabrook 18-wheeler accident?",
          "answer": "Compensation from an 18-wheeler accident in Seabrook typically includes economic damages (medical bills, lost wages, future medical care, property damage) and non-economic damages (pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life). Commercial trucks carry higher insurance minimums than passenger vehicles, often providing greater recovery potential. New Hampshire's modified-51 system affects how compensation is calculated based on fault allocation."
      },
      {
          "question": "How long does a truck accident case take in Seabrook?",
          "answer": "Truck accident cases in Seabrook generally take between one and three years to resolve. Timeline depends on injury severity, complexity of liability issues, and whether the case settles or goes to trial. Cases involving multiple defendants or catastrophic injuries typically take longer. Your attorney will work to resolve your case efficiently while maximizing your recovery."
      },
      {
          "question": "Can I still recover damages if I was partially at fault for a Seabrook truck accident?",
          "answer": "Yes, but New Hampshire follows modified comparative negligence with a 51% bar. You can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, with your recovery reduced by your fault percentage. If you are 51% or more at fault, you cannot recover. Insurance companies often try to shift blame to accident victims—experienced attorneys know how to counter these tactics."
      },
      {
          "question": "What insurance covers truck accidents in Seabrook?",
          "answer": "Multiple insurance policies may cover a Seabrook truck accident: the trucking company's liability insurance (federal minimum $750,000-$5 million depending on cargo), the driver's personal insurance, your own uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage, and your health insurance or Med-Pay. An attorney will identify all available coverage sources to maximize your recovery."
      },
      {
          "question": "What evidence should I gather after a truck accident in Seabrook?",
          "answer": "After a truck accident in Seabrook, gather as much evidence as possible: photos of all vehicles and the scene, the truck's DOT number and company information, driver information, witness contact details, and the police report number. Seek immediate medical attention and keep all medical records. Critical truck evidence like electronic logging device data, dash cam footage, and inspection records must be preserved quickly—your attorney can send a spoliation letter requiring the trucking company to preserve this evidence."
      },
      {
          "question": "Why do I need a truck accident lawyer in Seabrook?",
          "answer": "Truck accident cases require attorneys who understand both federal trucking regulations and New Hampshire law. Trucking companies have experienced legal teams and insurers who begin building their defense immediately after an accident. A qualified truck accident lawyer knows how to preserve critical evidence, investigate regulatory violations, identify all liable parties, and negotiate with commercial insurers."
      },
      {
          "question": "What are common injuries in Seabrook truck accidents?",
          "answer": "Truck accidents in Seabrook often cause severe injuries due to the massive size difference between commercial trucks and passenger vehicles. Common injuries include traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord damage, multiple fractures, internal organ damage, burns, and wrongful death. Even 'minor' truck accidents frequently cause long-term injuries requiring extensive medical treatment. The Northeast region's winter ice and black ice contribute to particularly severe accident types."
