  truckingIndustry: `South Hill's location along I-95 means steady commercial truck traffic despite the city's size. I-95 corridor volume keeps 18-wheelers moving through day and night.

Commercial trucks in South Hill operate under tight schedules that can pressure drivers to violate federal hours-of-service regulations. Combined with winter storms, this creates serious accident risks for local residents.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in South Hill are governed by Virginia state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: Virginia has a 2-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Contributory Negligence**: Virginia follows the strict contributory negligence rule. If you are found even 1% at fault for the accident, you may be completely barred from recovering any damages. This makes legal representation crucial in Virginia truck accident cases.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our South Hill truck accident attorneys understand both Virginia law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,
