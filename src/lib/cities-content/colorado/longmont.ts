  truckingIndustry: `Longmont's economy relies heavily on commercial trucking for Mountain freight transport and Energy sector. The city's location along I-25 and I-70 makes it a critical logistics hub. Major distribution centers, warehouses, and industrial facilities generate thousands of daily truck trips through Longmont streets and highways.

The Colorado trucking industry employs tens of thousands of drivers and supports the state's economy. However, this heavy truck traffic also creates significant accident risks for Longmont residents. Commercial trucks weighing up to 80,000 pounds cause catastrophic injuries when they collide with passenger vehicles.

Longmont sees truck traffic from Agriculture and Outdoor recreation industry. These industries operate on tight delivery schedules that can pressure drivers to violate hours-of-service regulations, skip required rest breaks, and drive while fatigued.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Longmont are governed by Colorado state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: Colorado sets strict deadlines for filing personal injury and wrongful death claims. Missing this deadline bars your claim forever.

**Comparative Negligence**: Colorado's negligence laws determine how fault is allocated and may affect your recovery.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, maintenance, and cargo loading often establish negligence in truck accident cases.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against drivers, carriers, brokers, shippers, and maintenance companies.

Our Longmont truck accident attorneys understand both Colorado law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,
