  truckingIndustry: `Champaign's economy relies heavily on commercial trucking for Rail-truck intermodal and Agricultural products. The city's location along I-55 and I-57 makes it a critical logistics hub. Major distribution centers, warehouses, and industrial facilities generate thousands of daily truck trips through Champaign streets and highways.

The Illinois trucking industry employs tens of thousands of drivers and supports the state's economy. However, this heavy truck traffic also creates significant accident risks for Champaign residents. Commercial trucks weighing up to 80,000 pounds cause catastrophic injuries when they collide with passenger vehicles.

Champaign sees truck traffic from Manufacturing and E-commerce distribution. These industries operate on tight delivery schedules that can pressure drivers to violate hours-of-service regulations, skip required rest breaks, and drive while fatigued.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Champaign are governed by Illinois state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: Illinois sets strict deadlines for filing personal injury and wrongful death claims. Missing this deadline bars your claim forever.

**Comparative Negligence**: Illinois's negligence laws determine how fault is allocated and may affect your recovery.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, maintenance, and cargo loading often establish negligence in truck accident cases.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against drivers, carriers, brokers, shippers, and maintenance companies.

Our Champaign truck accident attorneys understand both Illinois law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,
