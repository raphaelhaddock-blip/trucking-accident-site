  truckingIndustry: `Elk Grove Village's location along I-55 means steady commercial truck traffic despite the city's size. Chicago hub volume keeps 18-wheelers moving through day and night.

The Illinois trucking industry employs thousands of drivers who transport goods across the state. However, factors including ice storms, blizzards create hazardous conditions. When tired or negligent drivers operate 80,000-pound vehicles in these conditions, catastrophic accidents result.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Elk Grove Village are governed by Illinois state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: Illinois has a 2-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Modified Comparative Negligence**: Illinois follows modified comparative negligence with a 51% bar. You can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, with your compensation reduced by your fault percentage. If you are 51% or more at fault, you are barred from recovery.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our Elk Grove Village truck accident attorneys understand both Illinois law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,

          "question": "What's the average settlement for Elk Grove Village truck crashes?",

      },
      {
          "question": "How long do I have to file a truck accident lawsuit in Illinois?",
          "answer": "You have 2 years from the accident date to file a truck accident lawsuit in Illinois. However, waiting too long can hurt your case even within this timeframe.

An investigation will identify all potentially liable parties to maximize your recovery."

      {
          "question": "What are common injuries in Elk Grove Village truck accidents?",

      {
          "question": "Why are truck accidents common on I-55 near Elk Grove Village?",
          "answer": "I-55 near Elk Grove Village sees high truck accident rates due to heavy commercial traffic volume combined with ice storms and blizzards. The corridor carries significant freight between major distribution points. Driver fatigue on long hauls, congestion-related rear-end collisions, and weather-related incidents all contribute to accident frequency in this area."

      {
