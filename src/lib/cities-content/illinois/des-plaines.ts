  truckingIndustry: `Truck traffic in Des Plaines stems largely from Chicago hub volume passing through on I-55. Local residents share roads with these large commercial vehicles.

The Illinois trucking industry employs thousands of drivers who transport goods across the state. However, factors including ice storms, blizzards create hazardous conditions. When tired or negligent drivers operate 80,000-pound vehicles in these conditions, catastrophic accidents result.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Des Plaines are governed by Illinois state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: Illinois has a 2-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Modified Comparative Negligence**: Illinois follows modified comparative negligence with a 51% bar. You can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, with your compensation reduced by your fault percentage. If you are 51% or more at fault, you are barred from recovery.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our Des Plaines truck accident attorneys understand both Illinois law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,

  faqs: [
      {
          "question": "What compensation can I expect from a Des Plaines 18-wheeler accident?",
          "answer": "Compensation from an 18-wheeler accident in Des Plaines typically includes economic damages (medical bills, lost wages, future medical care, property damage) and non-economic damages (pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life). Commercial trucks carry higher insurance minimums than passenger vehicles, often providing greater recovery potential. Illinois's modified-51 system affects how compensation is calculated based on fault allocation."
      },
      {
          "question": "How long does a truck accident case take in Des Plaines?",
          "answer": "Truck accident cases in Des Plaines generally take between one and three years to resolve. Timeline depends on injury severity, complexity of liability issues, and whether the case settles or goes to trial. Cases involving multiple defendants or catastrophic injuries typically take longer. Your attorney will work to resolve your case efficiently while maximizing your recovery."
      },
      {
          "question": "Who can be held liable for a truck accident in Des Plaines?",
          "answer": "Multiple parties may be liable for a Des Plaines truck accident: the truck driver, the trucking company, the vehicle owner (if different), the cargo loading company, the maintenance provider, and potentially the truck or parts manufacturer. Federal regulations make trucking companies responsible for their drivers' conduct while operating company vehicles. An investigation will identify all potentially liable parties to maximize your recovery."
      },
      {
          "question": "How much does a truck accident lawyer in Des Plaines cost?",
          "answer": "Most truck accident lawyers in Des Plaines work on a contingency fee basis—you pay nothing upfront and no attorney fees unless you win. The attorney fee is typically a percentage of your recovery, usually 33-40% depending on whether the case settles or goes to trial. This arrangement allows accident victims to access quality legal representation regardless of their financial situation. You should also understand what case costs are covered."

      {
          "question": "What evidence should I gather after a truck accident in Des Plaines?",
          "answer": "After a truck accident in Des Plaines, gather as much evidence as possible: photos of all vehicles and the scene, the truck's DOT number and company information, driver information, witness contact details, and the police report number. Seek immediate medical attention and keep all medical records. Critical truck evidence like electronic logging device data, dash cam footage, and inspection records must be preserved quickly—your attorney can send a spoliation letter requiring the trucking company to preserve this evidence."
      },
      {
          "question": "Why do I need a truck accident lawyer in Des Plaines?",
          "answer": "Truck accident cases require attorneys who understand both federal trucking regulations and Illinois law. Trucking companies have experienced legal teams and insurers who begin building their defense immediately after an accident. A qualified truck accident lawyer knows how to preserve critical evidence, investigate regulatory violations, identify all liable parties, and negotiate with commercial insurers."
      },
      {
          "question": "Why are truck accidents common on I-55 near Des Plaines?",
          "answer": "I-55 near Des Plaines sees high truck accident rates due to heavy commercial traffic volume combined with ice storms and blizzards. The corridor carries significant freight between major distribution points. Driver fatigue on long hauls, congestion-related rear-end collisions, and weather-related incidents all contribute to accident frequency in this area."
