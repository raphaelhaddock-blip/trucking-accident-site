  truckingIndustry: `Apple Valley's location along I-94 means steady commercial truck traffic despite the city's size. manufacturing hub volume keeps 18-wheelers moving through day and night.

Commercial trucks in Apple Valley operate under tight schedules that can pressure drivers to violate federal hours-of-service regulations. Combined with lake-effect snow, this creates serious accident risks for local residents.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Apple Valley are governed by Minnesota state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: Minnesota has a 6-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Modified Comparative Negligence**: Minnesota follows modified comparative negligence with a 51% bar. You can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, with your compensation reduced by your fault percentage. If you are 51% or more at fault, you are barred from recovery.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our Apple Valley truck accident attorneys understand both Minnesota law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,
