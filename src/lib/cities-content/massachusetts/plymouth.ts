  truckingIndustry: `Plymouth's location along I-90 means steady commercial truck traffic despite the city's size. urban congestion keeps 18-wheelers moving through day and night.

Commercial trucks in Plymouth operate under tight schedules that can pressure drivers to violate federal hours-of-service regulations. Combined with winter ice, this creates serious accident risks for local residents.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Plymouth are governed by Massachusetts state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: Massachusetts has a 3-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Modified Comparative Negligence**: Massachusetts follows modified comparative negligence with a 51% bar. You can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, with your compensation reduced by your fault percentage. If you are 51% or more at fault, you are barred from recovery.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our Plymouth truck accident attorneys understand both Massachusetts law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,

  faqs: [
      {
          "question": "What's the average settlement for Plymouth truck crashes?",
          "answer": "Truck accident settlements in rural areas like Plymouth can be substantial despite lower population density. The Northeast region's unique trucking hazards—winter ice and black ice—often contribute to severe accidents. While average settlements are difficult to calculate, serious truck accident cases regularly result in six and seven-figure recoveries."
      },
      {
          "question": "How long do I have to file a truck accident lawsuit in Massachusetts?",
          "answer": "You have 3 years from the accident date to file a truck accident lawsuit in Massachusetts. However, waiting too long can hurt your case even within this timeframe. Critical evidence like electronic logging device data, dash cam footage, and driver logs may be destroyed or overwritten. Contact an attorney promptly to preserve evidence and protect your rights."
      },
      {
          "question": "Can I still recover damages if I was partially at fault for a Plymouth truck accident?",
          "answer": "Yes, but Massachusetts follows modified comparative negligence with a 51% bar. You can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, with your recovery reduced by your fault percentage. If you are 51% or more at fault, you cannot recover. Insurance companies often try to shift blame to accident victims—experienced attorneys know how to counter these tactics."
      },
      {
          "question": "What insurance covers truck accidents in Plymouth?",
          "answer": "Multiple insurance policies may cover a Plymouth truck accident: the trucking company's liability insurance (federal minimum $750,000-$5 million depending on cargo), the driver's personal insurance, your own uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage, and your health insurance or Med-Pay. An attorney will identify all available coverage sources to maximize your recovery."
      },
      {
          "question": "What are common injuries in Plymouth truck accidents?",
          "answer": "Truck accidents in Plymouth often cause severe injuries due to the massive size difference between commercial trucks and passenger vehicles. Common injuries include traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord damage, multiple fractures, internal organ damage, burns, and wrongful death. Even 'minor' truck accidents frequently cause long-term injuries requiring extensive medical treatment. The Northeast region's winter ice and black ice contribute to particularly severe accident types."
      },
      {
          "question": "What happens after I hire a Plymouth truck accident lawyer?",
          "answer": "After hiring a truck accident lawyer in Plymouth, your attorney will: send preservation letters to protect evidence, investigate the accident scene and trucking company records, gather medical records and bills, identify all liable parties and insurance coverage, calculate your damages, negotiate with insurance companies, and file a lawsuit if necessary. Most cases settle without trial, but your attorney should be prepared to try your case if needed."
      },
      {
          "question": "How much does a truck accident lawyer in Plymouth cost?",
          "answer": "Most truck accident lawyers in Plymouth work on a contingency fee basis—you pay nothing upfront and no attorney fees unless you win. The attorney fee is typically a percentage of your recovery, usually 33-40% depending on whether the case settles or goes to trial. This arrangement allows accident victims to access quality legal representation regardless of their financial situation. You should also understand what case costs are covered."
