  truckingIndustry: `Though smaller than major metros, Framingham sits on key trucking routes in Massachusetts. urban congestion brings commercial vehicles past residential and commercial areas.

Commercial trucks in Framingham operate under tight schedules that can pressure drivers to violate federal hours-of-service regulations. Combined with winter ice, this creates serious accident risks for local residents.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Framingham are governed by Massachusetts state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: Massachusetts has a 3-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Modified Comparative Negligence**: Massachusetts follows modified comparative negligence with a 51% bar. You can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, with your compensation reduced by your fault percentage. If you are 51% or more at fault, you are barred from recovery.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our Framingham truck accident attorneys understand both Massachusetts law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,

You can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, with your recovery reduced by your fault percentage. If you are 51% or more at fault, you cannot recover.

Common injuries include traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord damage, multiple fractures, internal organ damage, burns, and wrongful death. Even 'minor' truck accidents frequently cause long-term injuries requiring extensive medical treatment. The Northeast region's winter ice and black ice contribute to particularly severe accident types."
