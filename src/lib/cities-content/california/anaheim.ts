  truckingIndustry: `Anaheim serves as an important waypoint for port traffic in California. The city's location on I-5 brings significant 18-wheeler traffic.

The California trucking industry employs thousands of drivers who transport goods across the state. However, factors including rain, fog create hazardous conditions. When tired or negligent drivers operate 80,000-pound vehicles in these conditions, catastrophic accidents result.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Anaheim are governed by California state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: California has a 2-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Comparative Negligence**: California follows pure comparative fault. You can recover damages even if you were partially at fault, though your recovery is reduced by your percentage of fault. Even if you were 90% at fault, you could still recover 10% of your damages.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our Anaheim truck accident attorneys understand both California law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,

          "question": "What is the statute of limitations for truck accident cases in Anaheim, California?",

Federal regulations make trucking companies responsible for their drivers' conduct while operating company vehicles. An investigation will identify all potentially liable parties to maximize your recovery."

An attorney will identify all available coverage sources to maximize your recovery."

The attorney fee is typically a percentage of your recovery, usually 33-40% depending on whether the case settles or goes to trial.

      {
          "question": "Why are truck accidents common on I-5 near Anaheim?",
          "answer": "I-5 near Anaheim sees high truck accident rates due to heavy commercial traffic volume combined with rain and fog. The corridor carries significant freight between major distribution points. Driver fatigue on long hauls, congestion-related rear-end collisions, and weather-related incidents all contribute to accident frequency in this area."
