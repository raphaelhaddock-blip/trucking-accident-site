  truckingIndustry: `Commercial trucking is vital to Norwalk's economy, connecting local businesses to port traffic. I-5 through the city sees heavy truck volumes year-round.

Commercial trucks in Norwalk operate under tight schedules that can pressure drivers to violate federal hours-of-service regulations. Combined with rain, this creates serious accident risks for local residents.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Norwalk are governed by California state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: California has a 2-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Comparative Negligence**: California follows pure comparative fault. You can recover damages even if you were partially at fault, though your recovery is reduced by your percentage of fault. Even if you were 90% at fault, you could still recover 10% of your damages.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our Norwalk truck accident attorneys understand both California law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,

  faqs: [
      {
          "question": "What's the average settlement for Norwalk truck crashes?",
          "answer": "Settlement amounts for Norwalk truck accidents vary based on injury severity, liability clarity, and insurance coverage. Serious injuries typically result in settlements ranging from $250,000 to over $1 million. Consult with a local attorney who understands California law to evaluate your potential case value."
      },
      {
          "question": "How long do I have to file a truck accident lawsuit in California?",
          "answer": "You have 2 years from the accident date to file a truck accident lawsuit in California. However, waiting too long can hurt your case even within this timeframe. Critical evidence like electronic logging device data, dash cam footage, and driver logs may be destroyed or overwritten. Contact an attorney promptly to preserve evidence and protect your rights."
      },
      {
          "question": "Can I still recover damages if I was partially at fault for a Norwalk truck accident?",
          "answer": "Yes. California follows pure comparative negligence, meaning you can recover damages even if you were mostly at fault. Your recovery is reduced by your percentage of fault. For example, if you were 70% at fault and had $100,000 in damages, you could still recover $30,000. However, insurance companies will try to maximize your assigned fault, making experienced legal representation important."
      },
      {
          "question": "Why do I need a truck accident lawyer in Norwalk?",
          "answer": "Truck accident cases require attorneys who understand both federal trucking regulations and California law. Trucking companies have experienced legal teams and insurers who begin building their defense immediately after an accident. A qualified truck accident lawyer knows how to preserve critical evidence, investigate regulatory violations, identify all liable parties, and negotiate with commercial insurers."
      },
      {
          "question": "What are common injuries in Norwalk truck accidents?",
          "answer": "Truck accidents in Norwalk often cause severe injuries due to the massive size difference between commercial trucks and passenger vehicles. Common injuries include traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord damage, multiple fractures, internal organ damage, burns, and wrongful death. Even 'minor' truck accidents frequently cause long-term injuries requiring extensive medical treatment. The Pacific region's rain and fog contribute to particularly severe accident types."
      },
      {
          "question": "What evidence should I gather after a truck accident in Norwalk?",
          "answer": "After a truck accident in Norwalk, gather as much evidence as possible: photos of all vehicles and the scene, the truck's DOT number and company information, driver information, witness contact details, and the police report number. Seek immediate medical attention and keep all medical records. Critical truck evidence like electronic logging device data, dash cam footage, and inspection records must be preserved quickly—your attorney can send a spoliation letter requiring the trucking company to preserve this evidence."
      },
      {
          "question": "What happens after I hire a Norwalk truck accident lawyer?",
          "answer": "After hiring a truck accident lawyer in Norwalk, your attorney will: send preservation letters to protect evidence, investigate the accident scene and trucking company records, gather medical records and bills, identify all liable parties and insurance coverage, calculate your damages, negotiate with insurance companies, and file a lawsuit if necessary. Most cases settle without trial, but your attorney should be prepared to try your case if needed."
