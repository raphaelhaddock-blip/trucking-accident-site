  truckingIndustry: `Carlsbad serves as an important waypoint for port traffic in California. The city's location on I-5 brings significant 18-wheeler traffic.

California commercial trucks carry goods vital to the economy, but this heavy traffic comes with risks. rain can make already-dangerous truck encounters even more hazardous for passenger vehicles.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Carlsbad are governed by California state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: California has a 2-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Comparative Negligence**: California follows pure comparative fault. You can recover damages even if you were partially at fault, though your recovery is reduced by your percentage of fault. Even if you were 90% at fault, you could still recover 10% of your damages.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our Carlsbad truck accident attorneys understand both California law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,

          "question": "What is the statute of limitations for truck accident cases in Carlsbad, California?",
          "answer": "California has a 2-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. This means you must file your lawsuit within 2 years of the accident date. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be. Evidence preservation is also critical—trucking companies may legally destroy certain records after federal retention periods expire."

For example, if you were 70% at fault and had $100,000 in damages, you could still recover $30,000. However, insurance companies will try to maximize your assigned fault, making experienced legal representation important."

Seek immediate medical attention and keep all medical records.
