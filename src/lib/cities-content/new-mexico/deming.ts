  truckingIndustry: `Located on I-40, Deming sees truck traffic from border crossing traffic despite its smaller population. This creates risks for local residents.

The New Mexico trucking industry employs thousands of drivers who transport goods across the state. However, factors including extreme heat, monsoon storms create hazardous conditions. When tired or negligent drivers operate 80,000-pound vehicles in these conditions, catastrophic accidents result.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Deming are governed by New Mexico state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: New Mexico has a 3-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Comparative Negligence**: New Mexico follows pure comparative fault. You can recover damages even if you were partially at fault, though your recovery is reduced by your percentage of fault. Even if you were 90% at fault, you could still recover 10% of your damages.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our Deming truck accident attorneys understand both New Mexico law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,

          "question": "What's the average settlement for Deming truck crashes?",
          "answer": "Truck accident settlements in rural areas like Deming can be substantial despite lower population density. The Southwest region's unique trucking hazards—extreme heat and monsoon storms—often contribute to severe accidents. While average settlements are difficult to calculate, serious truck accident cases regularly result in six and seven-figure recoveries."
      },
      {
          "question": "How long do I have to file a truck accident lawsuit in New Mexico?",
          "answer": "You have 3 years from the accident date to file a truck accident lawsuit in New Mexico. However, waiting too long can hurt your case even within this timeframe. Critical evidence like electronic logging device data, dash cam footage, and driver logs may be destroyed or overwritten. Contact an attorney promptly to preserve evidence and protect your rights."
      },
      {
          "question": "Can I still recover damages if I was partially at fault for a Deming truck accident?",
          "answer": "Yes. New Mexico follows pure comparative negligence, meaning you can recover damages even if you were mostly at fault. Your recovery is reduced by your percentage of fault. For example, if you were 70% at fault and had $100,000 in damages, you could still recover $30,000. However, insurance companies will try to maximize your assigned fault, making experienced legal representation important."
      },
      {
          "question": "Why do I need a truck accident lawyer in Deming?",
          "answer": "Truck accident cases require attorneys who understand both federal trucking regulations and New Mexico law. Trucking companies have experienced legal teams and insurers who begin building their defense immediately after an accident. A qualified truck accident lawyer knows how to preserve critical evidence, investigate regulatory violations, identify all liable parties, and negotiate with commercial insurers."
      },
      {
          "question": "How much does a truck accident lawyer in Deming cost?",
          "answer": "Most truck accident lawyers in Deming work on a contingency fee basis—you pay nothing upfront and no attorney fees unless you win. The attorney fee is typically a percentage of your recovery, usually 33-40% depending on whether the case settles or goes to trial. This arrangement allows accident victims to access quality legal representation regardless of their financial situation. You should also understand what case costs are covered."
      },
      {
          "question": "What are common injuries in Deming truck accidents?",
          "answer": "Truck accidents in Deming often cause severe injuries due to the massive size difference between commercial trucks and passenger vehicles. Common injuries include traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord damage, multiple fractures, internal organ damage, burns, and wrongful death. Even 'minor' truck accidents frequently cause long-term injuries requiring extensive medical treatment. The Southwest region's extreme heat and monsoon storms contribute to particularly severe accident types."
      },
      {
          "question": "Why are truck accidents common on I-40 near Deming?",
          "answer": "I-40 near Deming sees high truck accident rates due to heavy commercial traffic volume combined with extreme heat and monsoon storms. The corridor carries significant freight between major distribution points. Driver fatigue on long hauls, congestion-related rear-end collisions, and weather-related incidents all contribute to accident frequency in this area."
