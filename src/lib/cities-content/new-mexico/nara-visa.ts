  truckingIndustry: `Nara Visa's location along I-40 means steady commercial truck traffic despite the city's size. border crossing traffic keeps 18-wheelers moving through day and night.

Commercial trucks in Nara Visa operate under tight schedules that can pressure drivers to violate federal hours-of-service regulations. Combined with extreme heat, this creates serious accident risks for local residents.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Nara Visa are governed by New Mexico state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: New Mexico has a 3-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Comparative Negligence**: New Mexico follows pure comparative fault. You can recover damages even if you were partially at fault, though your recovery is reduced by your percentage of fault. Even if you were 90% at fault, you could still recover 10% of your damages.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our Nara Visa truck accident attorneys understand both New Mexico law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,

For example, if you were 70% at fault and had $100,000 in damages, you could still recover $30,000.
