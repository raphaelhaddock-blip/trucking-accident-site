  truckingIndustry: `Las Cruces's economy relies heavily on commercial trucking for Manufacturing and Distribution. The city's location along I-95 and I-40 makes it a critical logistics hub. Major distribution centers, warehouses, and industrial facilities generate thousands of daily truck trips through Las Cruces streets and highways.

The New Mexico trucking industry employs tens of thousands of drivers and supports the state's economy. However, this heavy truck traffic also creates significant accident risks for Las Cruces residents. Commercial trucks weighing up to 80,000 pounds cause catastrophic injuries when they collide with passenger vehicles.

Las Cruces sees truck traffic from Agriculture and Retail. These industries operate on tight delivery schedules that can pressure drivers to violate hours-of-service regulations, skip required rest breaks, and drive while fatigued.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Las Cruces are governed by New Mexico state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: New Mexico sets strict deadlines for filing personal injury and wrongful death claims. Missing this deadline bars your claim forever.

**Comparative Negligence**: New Mexico's negligence laws determine how fault is allocated and may affect your recovery.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, maintenance, and cargo loading often establish negligence in truck accident cases.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against drivers, carriers, brokers, shippers, and maintenance companies.

Our Las Cruces truck accident attorneys understand both New Mexico law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,
