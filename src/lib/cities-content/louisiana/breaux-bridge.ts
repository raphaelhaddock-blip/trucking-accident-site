  truckingIndustry: `Truck traffic in Breaux Bridge stems largely from port traffic passing through on I-10. Local residents share roads with these large commercial vehicles.

The Louisiana trucking industry employs thousands of drivers who transport goods across the state. However, factors including hurricanes, tropical storms create hazardous conditions. When tired or negligent drivers operate 80,000-pound vehicles in these conditions, catastrophic accidents result.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Breaux Bridge are governed by Louisiana state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: Louisiana has a 1-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Comparative Negligence**: Louisiana follows pure comparative fault. You can recover damages even if you were partially at fault, though your recovery is reduced by your percentage of fault. Even if you were 90% at fault, you could still recover 10% of your damages.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our Breaux Bridge truck accident attorneys understand both Louisiana law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,
