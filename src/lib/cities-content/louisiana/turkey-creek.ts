  truckingIndustry: `Turkey Creek's location along I-10 means steady commercial truck traffic despite the city's size. port traffic keeps 18-wheelers moving through day and night.

Commercial trucks in Turkey Creek operate under tight schedules that can pressure drivers to violate federal hours-of-service regulations. Combined with hurricanes, this creates serious accident risks for local residents.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Turkey Creek are governed by Louisiana state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: Louisiana has a 1-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Comparative Negligence**: Louisiana follows pure comparative fault. You can recover damages even if you were partially at fault, though your recovery is reduced by your percentage of fault. Even if you were 90% at fault, you could still recover 10% of your damages.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our Turkey Creek truck accident attorneys understand both Louisiana law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,
