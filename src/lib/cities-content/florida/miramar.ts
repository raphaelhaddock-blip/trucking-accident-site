  truckingIndustry: `Commercial trucking is vital to Miramar's economy, connecting local businesses to distribution hub volume. I-95 through the city sees heavy truck volumes year-round.

The Florida trucking industry employs thousands of drivers who transport goods across the state. However, factors including summer thunderstorms, hurricanes create hazardous conditions. When tired or negligent drivers operate 80,000-pound vehicles in these conditions, catastrophic accidents result.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Miramar are governed by Florida state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: Florida has a 2-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Modified Comparative Negligence**: Florida follows modified comparative negligence with a 51% bar. You can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, with your compensation reduced by your fault percentage. If you are 51% or more at fault, you are barred from recovery.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our Miramar truck accident attorneys understand both Florida law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,

      },
      {
          "question": "Why are truck accidents common on I-95 near Miramar?",
          "answer": "I-95 near Miramar sees high truck accident rates due to heavy commercial traffic volume combined with summer thunderstorms and hurricanes. The corridor carries significant freight between major distribution points. Driver fatigue on long hauls, congestion-related rear-end collisions, and weather-related incidents all contribute to accident frequency in this area."
      },
      {
          "question": "What are common injuries in Miramar truck accidents?",
          "answer": "Truck accidents in Miramar often cause severe injuries due to the massive size difference between commercial trucks and passenger vehicles. Common injuries include traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord damage, multiple fractures, internal organ damage, burns, and wrongful death. Even 'minor' truck accidents frequently cause long-term injuries requiring extensive medical treatment. The Southeast region's summer thunderstorms and hurricanes contribute to particularly severe accident types."
