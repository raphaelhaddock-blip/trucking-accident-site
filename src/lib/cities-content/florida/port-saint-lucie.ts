  truckingIndustry: `Truck traffic in Port Saint Lucie stems largely from distribution hub volume passing through on I-95. Local residents share roads with these large commercial vehicles.

The Florida trucking industry employs thousands of drivers who transport goods across the state. However, factors including summer thunderstorms, hurricanes create hazardous conditions. When tired or negligent drivers operate 80,000-pound vehicles in these conditions, catastrophic accidents result.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Port Saint Lucie are governed by Florida state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: Florida has a 2-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Modified Comparative Negligence**: Florida follows modified comparative negligence with a 51% bar. You can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, with your compensation reduced by your fault percentage. If you are 51% or more at fault, you are barred from recovery.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our Port Saint Lucie truck accident attorneys understand both Florida law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,

  faqs: [
      {
          "question": "What compensation can I expect from a Port Saint Lucie 18-wheeler accident?",
          "answer": "Compensation from an 18-wheeler accident in Port Saint Lucie typically includes economic damages (medical bills, lost wages, future medical care, property damage) and non-economic damages (pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life). Commercial trucks carry higher insurance minimums than passenger vehicles, often providing greater recovery potential. Florida's modified-51 system affects how compensation is calculated based on fault allocation."
      },
      {
          "question": "How long does a truck accident case take in Port Saint Lucie?",
          "answer": "Truck accident cases in Port Saint Lucie generally take between one and three years to resolve. Timeline depends on injury severity, complexity of liability issues, and whether the case settles or goes to trial. Cases involving multiple defendants or catastrophic injuries typically take longer. Your attorney will work to resolve your case efficiently while maximizing your recovery."
      },
      {
          "question": "Can I still recover damages if I was partially at fault for a Port Saint Lucie truck accident?",
          "answer": "Yes, but Florida follows modified comparative negligence with a 51% bar. You can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, with your recovery reduced by your fault percentage. If you are 51% or more at fault, you cannot recover. Insurance companies often try to shift blame to accident victims—experienced attorneys know how to counter these tactics."
      },
      {
          "question": "How much does a truck accident lawyer in Port Saint Lucie cost?",
          "answer": "Most truck accident lawyers in Port Saint Lucie work on a contingency fee basis—you pay nothing upfront and no attorney fees unless you win. The attorney fee is typically a percentage of your recovery, usually 33-40% depending on whether the case settles or goes to trial. This arrangement allows accident victims to access quality legal representation regardless of their financial situation. You should also understand what case costs are covered."
      },
      {
          "question": "Why do I need a truck accident lawyer in Port Saint Lucie?",
          "answer": "Truck accident cases require attorneys who understand both federal trucking regulations and Florida law. Trucking companies have experienced legal teams and insurers who begin building their defense immediately after an accident. A qualified truck accident lawyer knows how to preserve critical evidence, investigate regulatory violations, identify all liable parties, and negotiate with commercial insurers."
      },
      {
          "question": "What insurance covers truck accidents in Port Saint Lucie?",
          "answer": "Multiple insurance policies may cover a Port Saint Lucie truck accident: the trucking company's liability insurance (federal minimum $750,000-$5 million depending on cargo), the driver's personal insurance, your own uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage, and your health insurance or Med-Pay. An attorney will identify all available coverage sources to maximize your recovery."
      },
      {
          "question": "Why are truck accidents common on I-95 near Port Saint Lucie?",
          "answer": "I-95 near Port Saint Lucie sees high truck accident rates due to heavy commercial traffic volume combined with summer thunderstorms and hurricanes. The corridor carries significant freight between major distribution points. Driver fatigue on long hauls, congestion-related rear-end collisions, and weather-related incidents all contribute to accident frequency in this area."
