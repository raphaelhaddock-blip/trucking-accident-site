  truckingIndustry: `Though smaller than major metros, Lauderhill sits on key trucking routes in Florida. distribution hub volume brings commercial vehicles past residential and commercial areas.

Florida commercial trucks carry goods vital to the economy, but this heavy traffic comes with risks. summer thunderstorms can make already-dangerous truck encounters even more hazardous for passenger vehicles.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Lauderhill are governed by Florida state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: Florida has a 2-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Modified Comparative Negligence**: Florida follows modified comparative negligence with a 51% bar. You can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, with your compensation reduced by your fault percentage. If you are 51% or more at fault, you are barred from recovery.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our Lauderhill truck accident attorneys understand both Florida law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,
