  truckingIndustry: `Tampa serves as an important waypoint for distribution hub volume in Florida. The city's location on I-95 brings significant 18-wheeler traffic.

Commercial trucks in Tampa operate under tight schedules that can pressure drivers to violate federal hours-of-service regulations. Combined with summer thunderstorms, this creates serious accident risks for local residents.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Tampa are governed by Florida state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: Florida has a 2-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Modified Comparative Negligence**: Florida follows modified comparative negligence with a 51% bar. You can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, with your compensation reduced by your fault percentage. If you are 51% or more at fault, you are barred from recovery.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our Tampa truck accident attorneys understand both Florida law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,

          "question": "What is the statute of limitations for truck accident cases in Tampa, Florida?",
          "answer": "Florida has a 2-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. This means you must file your lawsuit within 2 years of the accident date. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

Federal regulations make trucking companies responsible for their drivers' conduct while operating company vehicles. An investigation will identify all potentially liable parties to maximize your recovery."

Most cases settle without trial, but your attorney should be prepared to try your case if needed."

          "question": "How much does a truck accident lawyer in Tampa cost?",

      {
          "question": "What are common injuries in Tampa truck accidents?",
          "answer": "Truck accidents in Tampa often cause severe injuries due to the massive size difference between commercial trucks and passenger vehicles. Common injuries include traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord damage, multiple fractures, internal organ damage, burns, and wrongful death. Even 'minor' truck accidents frequently cause long-term injuries requiring extensive medical treatment. The Southeast region's summer thunderstorms and hurricanes contribute to particularly severe accident types."
