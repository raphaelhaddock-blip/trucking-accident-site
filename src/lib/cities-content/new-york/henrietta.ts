  truckingIndustry: `Henrietta's location along I-87 means steady commercial truck traffic despite the city's size. urban congestion keeps 18-wheelers moving through day and night.

The New York trucking industry employs thousands of drivers who transport goods across the state. However, factors including winter ice, black ice create hazardous conditions. When tired or negligent drivers operate 80,000-pound vehicles in these conditions, catastrophic accidents result.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Henrietta are governed by New York state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: New York has a 3-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Comparative Negligence**: New York follows pure comparative fault. You can recover damages even if you were partially at fault, though your recovery is reduced by your percentage of fault. Even if you were 90% at fault, you could still recover 10% of your damages.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our Henrietta truck accident attorneys understand both New York law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,

  faqs: [
      {
          "question": "What's the average settlement for Henrietta truck crashes?",
          "answer": "Truck accident settlements in rural areas like Henrietta can be substantial despite lower population density. The Northeast region's unique trucking hazards—winter ice and black ice—often contribute to severe accidents. While average settlements are difficult to calculate, serious truck accident cases regularly result in six and seven-figure recoveries."
      },
      {
          "question": "How long do I have to file a truck accident lawsuit in New York?",
          "answer": "You have 3 years from the accident date to file a truck accident lawsuit in New York. However, waiting too long can hurt your case even within this timeframe. Critical evidence like electronic logging device data, dash cam footage, and driver logs may be destroyed or overwritten. Contact an attorney promptly to preserve evidence and protect your rights."

          "question": "Can I still recover damages if I was partially at fault for a Henrietta truck accident?",
          "answer": "Yes. New York follows pure comparative negligence, meaning you can recover damages even if you were mostly at fault. Your recovery is reduced by your percentage of fault. For example, if you were 70% at fault and had $100,000 in damages, you could still recover $30,000. However, insurance companies will try to maximize your assigned fault, making experienced legal representation important."

      },
      {
          "question": "What are common injuries in Henrietta truck accidents?",

Common injuries include traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord damage, multiple fractures, internal organ damage, burns, and wrongful death. Even 'minor' truck accidents frequently cause long-term injuries requiring extensive medical treatment.
