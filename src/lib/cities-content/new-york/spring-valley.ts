  truckingIndustry: `Spring Valley's location along I-87 means steady commercial truck traffic despite the city's size. urban congestion keeps 18-wheelers moving through day and night.

Commercial trucks in Spring Valley operate under tight schedules that can pressure drivers to violate federal hours-of-service regulations. Combined with winter ice, this creates serious accident risks for local residents.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Spring Valley are governed by New York state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: New York has a 3-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Comparative Negligence**: New York follows pure comparative fault. You can recover damages even if you were partially at fault, though your recovery is reduced by your percentage of fault. Even if you were 90% at fault, you could still recover 10% of your damages.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our Spring Valley truck accident attorneys understand both New York law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,

  faqs: [
      {
          "question": "What's the average settlement for Spring Valley truck crashes?",
          "answer": "Truck accident settlements in rural areas like Spring Valley can be substantial despite lower population density. The Northeast region's unique trucking hazards—winter ice and black ice—often contribute to severe accidents.

          "question": "How long do I have to file a truck accident lawsuit in New York?",
          "answer": "You have 3 years from the accident date to file a truck accident lawsuit in New York. However, waiting too long can hurt your case even within this timeframe.

Federal regulations make trucking companies responsible for their drivers' conduct while operating company vehicles. An investigation will identify all potentially liable parties to maximize your recovery."

An attorney will identify all available coverage sources to maximize your recovery."
      },
      {

      {
          "question": "What evidence should I gather after a truck accident in Spring Valley?",

Seek immediate medical attention and keep all medical records. Critical truck evidence like electronic logging device data, dash cam footage, and inspection records must be preserved quickly—your attorney can send a spoliation letter requiring the trucking company to preserve this evidence."
