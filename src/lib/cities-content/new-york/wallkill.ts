  truckingIndustry: `Truck traffic in Wallkill stems largely from urban congestion passing through on I-87. Local residents share roads with these large commercial vehicles.

The New York trucking industry employs thousands of drivers who transport goods across the state. However, factors including winter ice, black ice create hazardous conditions. When tired or negligent drivers operate 80,000-pound vehicles in these conditions, catastrophic accidents result.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Wallkill are governed by New York state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: New York has a 3-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Comparative Negligence**: New York follows pure comparative fault. You can recover damages even if you were partially at fault, though your recovery is reduced by your percentage of fault. Even if you were 90% at fault, you could still recover 10% of your damages.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our Wallkill truck accident attorneys understand both New York law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,

  faqs: [
      {
          "question": "What compensation can I expect from a Wallkill 18-wheeler accident?",
          "answer": "Compensation from an 18-wheeler accident in Wallkill typically includes economic damages (medical bills, lost wages, future medical care, property damage) and non-economic damages (pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life). Commercial trucks carry higher insurance minimums than passenger vehicles, often providing greater recovery potential. New York's pure-comparative system affects how compensation is calculated based on fault allocation."
      },
      {
          "question": "How long does a truck accident case take in Wallkill?",
          "answer": "Truck accident cases in Wallkill generally take between one and three years to resolve. Timeline depends on injury severity, complexity of liability issues, and whether the case settles or goes to trial. Cases involving multiple defendants or catastrophic injuries typically take longer. Your attorney will work to resolve your case efficiently while maximizing your recovery."
      },
      {
          "question": "Can I still recover damages if I was partially at fault for a Wallkill truck accident?",
          "answer": "Yes. New York follows pure comparative negligence, meaning you can recover damages even if you were mostly at fault. Your recovery is reduced by your percentage of fault. For example, if you were 70% at fault and had $100,000 in damages, you could still recover $30,000. However, insurance companies will try to maximize your assigned fault, making experienced legal representation important."
      },
      {
          "question": "What insurance covers truck accidents in Wallkill?",
          "answer": "Multiple insurance policies may cover a Wallkill truck accident: the trucking company's liability insurance (federal minimum $750,000-$5 million depending on cargo), the driver's personal insurance, your own uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage, and your health insurance or Med-Pay. An attorney will identify all available coverage sources to maximize your recovery."
      },
      {
          "question": "How much does a truck accident lawyer in Wallkill cost?",
          "answer": "Most truck accident lawyers in Wallkill work on a contingency fee basis—you pay nothing upfront and no attorney fees unless you win. The attorney fee is typically a percentage of your recovery, usually 33-40% depending on whether the case settles or goes to trial. This arrangement allows accident victims to access quality legal representation regardless of their financial situation. You should also understand what case costs are covered."
      },
      {
          "question": "Why do I need a truck accident lawyer in Wallkill?",
          "answer": "Truck accident cases require attorneys who understand both federal trucking regulations and New York law. Trucking companies have experienced legal teams and insurers who begin building their defense immediately after an accident. A qualified truck accident lawyer knows how to preserve critical evidence, investigate regulatory violations, identify all liable parties, and negotiate with commercial insurers."
      },
      {
          "question": "What evidence should I gather after a truck accident in Wallkill?",
          "answer": "After a truck accident in Wallkill, gather as much evidence as possible: photos of all vehicles and the scene, the truck's DOT number and company information, driver information, witness contact details, and the police report number. Seek immediate medical attention and keep all medical records. Critical truck evidence like electronic logging device data, dash cam footage, and inspection records must be preserved quickly—your attorney can send a spoliation letter requiring the trucking company to preserve this evidence."
