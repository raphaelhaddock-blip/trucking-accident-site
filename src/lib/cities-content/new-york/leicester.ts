  truckingIndustry: `Though smaller than major metros, Leicester sits on key trucking routes in New York. urban congestion brings commercial vehicles past residential and commercial areas.

New York commercial trucks carry goods vital to the economy, but this heavy traffic comes with risks. winter ice can make already-dangerous truck encounters even more hazardous for passenger vehicles.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Leicester are governed by New York state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: New York has a 3-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Comparative Negligence**: New York follows pure comparative fault. You can recover damages even if you were partially at fault, though your recovery is reduced by your percentage of fault. Even if you were 90% at fault, you could still recover 10% of your damages.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our Leicester truck accident attorneys understand both New York law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,

For example, if you were 70% at fault and had $100,000 in damages, you could still recover $30,000.
