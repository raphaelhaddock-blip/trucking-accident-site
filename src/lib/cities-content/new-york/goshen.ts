  truckingIndustry: `Truck traffic in Goshen stems largely from urban congestion passing through on I-87. Local residents share roads with these large commercial vehicles.

The New York trucking industry employs thousands of drivers who transport goods across the state. However, factors including winter ice, black ice create hazardous conditions. When tired or negligent drivers operate 80,000-pound vehicles in these conditions, catastrophic accidents result.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Goshen are governed by New York state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: New York has a 3-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Comparative Negligence**: New York follows pure comparative fault. You can recover damages even if you were partially at fault, though your recovery is reduced by your percentage of fault. Even if you were 90% at fault, you could still recover 10% of your damages.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our Goshen truck accident attorneys understand both New York law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,

  faqs: [
      {
          "question": "What compensation can I expect from a Goshen 18-wheeler accident?",
          "answer": "Compensation from an 18-wheeler accident in Goshen typically includes economic damages (medical bills, lost wages, future medical care, property damage) and non-economic damages (pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life). Commercial trucks carry higher insurance minimums than passenger vehicles, often providing greater recovery potential. New York's pure-comparative system affects how compensation is calculated based on fault allocation."
      },
      {
          "question": "How long does a truck accident case take in Goshen?",
          "answer": "Truck accident cases in Goshen generally take between one and three years to resolve. Timeline depends on injury severity, complexity of liability issues, and whether the case settles or goes to trial. Cases involving multiple defendants or catastrophic injuries typically take longer. Your attorney will work to resolve your case efficiently while maximizing your recovery."

      {
          "question": "Can I still recover damages if I was partially at fault for a Goshen truck accident?",
          "answer": "Yes. New York follows pure comparative negligence, meaning you can recover damages even if you were mostly at fault. Your recovery is reduced by your percentage of fault. For example, if you were 70% at fault and had $100,000 in damages, you could still recover $30,000. However, insurance companies will try to maximize your assigned fault, making experienced legal representation important."

The attorney fee is typically a percentage of your recovery, usually 33-40% depending on whether the case settles or goes to trial. This arrangement allows accident victims to access quality legal representation regardless of their financial situation. You should also understand what case costs are covered."

      },
      {
          "question": "What are common injuries in Goshen truck accidents?",
          "answer": "Truck accidents in Goshen often cause severe injuries due to the massive size difference between commercial trucks and passenger vehicles. Common injuries include traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord damage, multiple fractures, internal organ damage, burns, and wrongful death. Even 'minor' truck accidents frequently cause long-term injuries requiring extensive medical treatment. The Northeast region's winter ice and black ice contribute to particularly severe accident types."
