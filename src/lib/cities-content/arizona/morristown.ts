  truckingIndustry: `Truck traffic in Morristown stems largely from border crossing traffic passing through on I-10. Local residents share roads with these large commercial vehicles.

Arizona commercial trucks carry goods vital to the economy, but this heavy traffic comes with risks. extreme heat can make already-dangerous truck encounters even more hazardous for passenger vehicles.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Morristown are governed by Arizona state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: Arizona has a 2-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Comparative Negligence**: Arizona follows pure comparative fault. You can recover damages even if you were partially at fault, though your recovery is reduced by your percentage of fault. Even if you were 90% at fault, you could still recover 10% of your damages.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our Morristown truck accident attorneys understand both Arizona law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,
