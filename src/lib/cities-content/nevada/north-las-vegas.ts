  truckingIndustry: `North Las Vegas's growing economy benefits from its trucking connections, but I-15 traffic also brings risk. border crossing traffic depends on this transportation corridor.

The Nevada trucking industry employs thousands of drivers who transport goods across the state. However, factors including extreme heat, monsoon storms create hazardous conditions. When tired or negligent drivers operate 80,000-pound vehicles in these conditions, catastrophic accidents result.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in North Las Vegas are governed by Nevada state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: Nevada has a 2-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Modified Comparative Negligence**: Nevada follows modified comparative negligence with a 51% bar. You can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, with your compensation reduced by your fault percentage. If you are 51% or more at fault, you are barred from recovery.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our North Las Vegas truck accident attorneys understand both Nevada law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,
