  truckingIndustry: `Fayetteville's economy relies heavily on commercial trucking for Furniture manufacturing and Tobacco/agriculture. The city's location along I-40 and I-77 makes it a critical logistics hub. Major distribution centers, warehouses, and industrial facilities generate thousands of daily truck trips through Fayetteville streets and highways.

The North Carolina trucking industry employs tens of thousands of drivers and supports the state's economy. However, this heavy truck traffic also creates significant accident risks for Fayetteville residents. Commercial trucks weighing up to 80,000 pounds cause catastrophic injuries when they collide with passenger vehicles.

Fayetteville sees truck traffic from Distribution centers and Pharmaceutical. These industries operate on tight delivery schedules that can pressure drivers to violate hours-of-service regulations, skip required rest breaks, and drive while fatigued.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Fayetteville are governed by North Carolina state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: North Carolina sets strict deadlines for filing personal injury and wrongful death claims. Missing this deadline bars your claim forever.

**Comparative Negligence**: North Carolina's negligence laws determine how fault is allocated and may affect your recovery.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, maintenance, and cargo loading often establish negligence in truck accident cases.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against drivers, carriers, brokers, shippers, and maintenance companies.

Our Fayetteville truck accident attorneys understand both North Carolina law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,
