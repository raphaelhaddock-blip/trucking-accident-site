  truckingIndustry: `Though smaller than major metros, Huntersville sits on key trucking routes in North Carolina. distribution hub volume brings commercial vehicles past residential and commercial areas.

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Huntersville are governed by North Carolina state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: North Carolina has a 3-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Contributory Negligence**: North Carolina follows the strict contributory negligence rule. If you are found even 1% at fault for the accident, you may be completely barred from recovering any damages. This makes legal representation crucial in North Carolina truck accident cases.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our Huntersville truck accident attorneys understand both North Carolina law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,
