  truckingIndustry: `Williston's location along I-94 means steady commercial truck traffic despite the city's size. agricultural hauling keeps 18-wheelers moving through day and night.

Commercial trucks in Williston operate under tight schedules that can pressure drivers to violate federal hours-of-service regulations. Combined with severe crosswinds, this creates serious accident risks for local residents.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Williston are governed by North Dakota state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: North Dakota has a 6-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Modified Comparative Negligence**: North Dakota uses a modified comparative fault system with a 50% bar. You can recover damages if you were 50% or less at fault, but your recovery is reduced by your fault percentage. If you are found more than 50% responsible, you cannot recover any damages.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our Williston truck accident attorneys understand both North Dakota law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,
