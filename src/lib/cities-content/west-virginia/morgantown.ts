  truckingIndustry: `Truck traffic in Morgantown stems largely from I-95 corridor volume passing through on I-77. Local residents share roads with these large commercial vehicles.

The West Virginia trucking industry employs thousands of drivers who transport goods across the state. However, factors including winter storms, summer thunderstorms create hazardous conditions. When tired or negligent drivers operate 80,000-pound vehicles in these conditions, catastrophic accidents result.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Morgantown are governed by West Virginia state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: West Virginia has a 2-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Modified Comparative Negligence**: West Virginia follows modified comparative negligence with a 51% bar. You can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, with your compensation reduced by your fault percentage. If you are 51% or more at fault, you are barred from recovery.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our Morgantown truck accident attorneys understand both West Virginia law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,

  faqs: [
      {
          "question": "What compensation can I expect from a Morgantown 18-wheeler accident?",
          "answer": "Compensation from an 18-wheeler accident in Morgantown typically includes economic damages (medical bills, lost wages, future medical care, property damage) and non-economic damages (pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life). Commercial trucks carry higher insurance minimums than passenger vehicles, often providing greater recovery potential. West Virginia's modified-51 system affects how compensation is calculated based on fault allocation."
      },

          "question": "How long does a truck accident case take in Morgantown?",
          "answer": "Truck accident cases in Morgantown generally take between one and three years to resolve.

You can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, with your recovery reduced by your fault percentage. If you are 51% or more at fault, you cannot recover. Insurance companies often try to shift blame to accident victims—experienced attorneys know how to counter these tactics."
