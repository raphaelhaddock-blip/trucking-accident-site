  truckingIndustry: `Though smaller than major metros, Leeds sits on key trucking routes in Alabama. distribution hub volume brings commercial vehicles past residential and commercial areas.

Alabama commercial trucks carry goods vital to the economy, but this heavy traffic comes with risks. summer thunderstorms can make already-dangerous truck encounters even more hazardous for passenger vehicles.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Leeds are governed by Alabama state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: Alabama has a 2-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Contributory Negligence**: Alabama follows the strict contributory negligence rule. If you are found even 1% at fault for the accident, you may be completely barred from recovering any damages. This makes legal representation crucial in Alabama truck accident cases.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our Leeds truck accident attorneys understand both Alabama law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,
