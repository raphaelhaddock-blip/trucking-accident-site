  truckingIndustry: `Truck traffic in Leesburg stems largely from distribution hub volume passing through on I-65. Local residents share roads with these large commercial vehicles.

The Alabama trucking industry employs thousands of drivers who transport goods across the state. However, factors including summer thunderstorms, hurricanes create hazardous conditions. When tired or negligent drivers operate 80,000-pound vehicles in these conditions, catastrophic accidents result.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Leesburg are governed by Alabama state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: Alabama has a 2-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Contributory Negligence**: Alabama follows the strict contributory negligence rule. If you are found even 1% at fault for the accident, you may be completely barred from recovering any damages. This makes legal representation crucial in Alabama truck accident cases.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our Leesburg truck accident attorneys understand both Alabama law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,
