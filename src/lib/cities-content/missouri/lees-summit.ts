  truckingIndustry: `Lee\'s Summit's economy relies heavily on commercial trucking for Manufacturing and Distribution. The city's location along I-44 and I-55 makes it a critical logistics hub. Major distribution centers, warehouses, and industrial facilities generate thousands of daily truck trips through Lee\'s Summit streets and highways.

The Missouri trucking industry employs tens of thousands of drivers and supports the state's economy. However, this heavy truck traffic also creates significant accident risks for Lee\'s Summit residents. Commercial trucks weighing up to 80,000 pounds cause catastrophic injuries when they collide with passenger vehicles.

Lee\'s Summit sees truck traffic from Agriculture and Retail. These industries operate on tight delivery schedules that can pressure drivers to violate hours-of-service regulations, skip required rest breaks, and drive while fatigued.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Lee\'s Summit are governed by Missouri state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: Missouri sets strict deadlines for filing personal injury and wrongful death claims. Missing this deadline bars your claim forever.

**Comparative Negligence**: Missouri's negligence laws determine how fault is allocated and may affect your recovery.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, maintenance, and cargo loading often establish negligence in truck accident cases.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against drivers, carriers, brokers, shippers, and maintenance companies.

Our Lee\'s Summit truck accident attorneys understand both Missouri law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,
