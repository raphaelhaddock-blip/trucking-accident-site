  truckingIndustry: `Perryville's location along I-70 means steady commercial truck traffic despite the city's size. Chicago hub volume keeps 18-wheelers moving through day and night.

Commercial trucks in Perryville operate under tight schedules that can pressure drivers to violate federal hours-of-service regulations. Combined with ice storms, this creates serious accident risks for local residents.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Perryville are governed by Missouri state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: Missouri has a 5-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Comparative Negligence**: Missouri follows pure comparative fault. You can recover damages even if you were partially at fault, though your recovery is reduced by your percentage of fault. Even if you were 90% at fault, you could still recover 10% of your damages.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our Perryville truck accident attorneys understand both Missouri law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,

  faqs: [
      {
          "question": "What's the average settlement for Perryville truck crashes?",
          "answer": "Truck accident settlements in rural areas like Perryville can be substantial despite lower population density. The Midwest region's unique trucking hazards—ice storms and blizzards—often contribute to severe accidents. While average settlements are difficult to calculate, serious truck accident cases regularly result in six and seven-figure recoveries."
      },
      {
          "question": "How long do I have to file a truck accident lawsuit in Missouri?",
          "answer": "You have 5 years from the accident date to file a truck accident lawsuit in Missouri. However, waiting too long can hurt your case even within this timeframe. Critical evidence like electronic logging device data, dash cam footage, and driver logs may be destroyed or overwritten. Contact an attorney promptly to preserve evidence and protect your rights."
      },
      {
          "question": "Can I still recover damages if I was partially at fault for a Perryville truck accident?",
          "answer": "Yes. Missouri follows pure comparative negligence, meaning you can recover damages even if you were mostly at fault. Your recovery is reduced by your percentage of fault. For example, if you were 70% at fault and had $100,000 in damages, you could still recover $30,000. However, insurance companies will try to maximize your assigned fault, making experienced legal representation important."
      },
      {
          "question": "What are common injuries in Perryville truck accidents?",
          "answer": "Truck accidents in Perryville often cause severe injuries due to the massive size difference between commercial trucks and passenger vehicles. Common injuries include traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord damage, multiple fractures, internal organ damage, burns, and wrongful death. Even 'minor' truck accidents frequently cause long-term injuries requiring extensive medical treatment. The Midwest region's ice storms and blizzards contribute to particularly severe accident types."
      },
      {
          "question": "What happens after I hire a Perryville truck accident lawyer?",
          "answer": "After hiring a truck accident lawyer in Perryville, your attorney will: send preservation letters to protect evidence, investigate the accident scene and trucking company records, gather medical records and bills, identify all liable parties and insurance coverage, calculate your damages, negotiate with insurance companies, and file a lawsuit if necessary. Most cases settle without trial, but your attorney should be prepared to try your case if needed."
      },
      {
          "question": "What evidence should I gather after a truck accident in Perryville?",
          "answer": "After a truck accident in Perryville, gather as much evidence as possible: photos of all vehicles and the scene, the truck's DOT number and company information, driver information, witness contact details, and the police report number. Seek immediate medical attention and keep all medical records. Critical truck evidence like electronic logging device data, dash cam footage, and inspection records must be preserved quickly—your attorney can send a spoliation letter requiring the trucking company to preserve this evidence."
      },
      {
          "question": "What insurance covers truck accidents in Perryville?",
          "answer": "Multiple insurance policies may cover a Perryville truck accident: the trucking company's liability insurance (federal minimum $750,000-$5 million depending on cargo), the driver's personal insurance, your own uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage, and your health insurance or Med-Pay. An attorney will identify all available coverage sources to maximize your recovery."
