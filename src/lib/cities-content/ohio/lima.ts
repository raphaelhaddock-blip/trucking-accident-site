  truckingIndustry: `Truck traffic in Lima stems largely from manufacturing hub volume passing through on I-71. Local residents share roads with these large commercial vehicles.

The Ohio trucking industry employs thousands of drivers who transport goods across the state. However, factors including lake-effect snow, extreme cold create hazardous conditions. When tired or negligent drivers operate 80,000-pound vehicles in these conditions, catastrophic accidents result.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Lima are governed by Ohio state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: Ohio has a 2-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Modified Comparative Negligence**: Ohio follows modified comparative negligence with a 51% bar. You can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, with your compensation reduced by your fault percentage. If you are 51% or more at fault, you are barred from recovery.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our Lima truck accident attorneys understand both Ohio law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,

  faqs: [
      {
          "question": "What compensation can I expect from a Lima 18-wheeler accident?",
          "answer": "Compensation from an 18-wheeler accident in Lima typically includes economic damages (medical bills, lost wages, future medical care, property damage) and non-economic damages (pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life). Commercial trucks carry higher insurance minimums than passenger vehicles, often providing greater recovery potential. Ohio's modified-51 system affects how compensation is calculated based on fault allocation."
      },
      {
          "question": "How long does a truck accident case take in Lima?",
          "answer": "Truck accident cases in Lima generally take between one and three years to resolve. Timeline depends on injury severity, complexity of liability issues, and whether the case settles or goes to trial. Cases involving multiple defendants or catastrophic injuries typically take longer. Your attorney will work to resolve your case efficiently while maximizing your recovery."
      },
      {
          "question": "Who can be held liable for a truck accident in Lima?",
          "answer": "Multiple parties may be liable for a Lima truck accident: the truck driver, the trucking company, the vehicle owner (if different), the cargo loading company, the maintenance provider, and potentially the truck or parts manufacturer. Federal regulations make trucking companies responsible for their drivers' conduct while operating company vehicles. An investigation will identify all potentially liable parties to maximize your recovery."
      },
      {
          "question": "What insurance covers truck accidents in Lima?",
          "answer": "Multiple insurance policies may cover a Lima truck accident: the trucking company's liability insurance (federal minimum $750,000-$5 million depending on cargo), the driver's personal insurance, your own uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage, and your health insurance or Med-Pay. An attorney will identify all available coverage sources to maximize your recovery."
      },
      {
          "question": "What are common injuries in Lima truck accidents?",
          "answer": "Truck accidents in Lima often cause severe injuries due to the massive size difference between commercial trucks and passenger vehicles. Common injuries include traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord damage, multiple fractures, internal organ damage, burns, and wrongful death. Even 'minor' truck accidents frequently cause long-term injuries requiring extensive medical treatment. The Great Lakes region's lake-effect snow and extreme cold contribute to particularly severe accident types."
      },
      {
          "question": "What evidence should I gather after a truck accident in Lima?",
          "answer": "After a truck accident in Lima, gather as much evidence as possible: photos of all vehicles and the scene, the truck's DOT number and company information, driver information, witness contact details, and the police report number. Seek immediate medical attention and keep all medical records. Critical truck evidence like electronic logging device data, dash cam footage, and inspection records must be preserved quickly—your attorney can send a spoliation letter requiring the trucking company to preserve this evidence."
      },
      {
          "question": "Why are truck accidents common on I-71 near Lima?",
          "answer": "I-71 near Lima sees high truck accident rates due to heavy commercial traffic volume combined with lake-effect snow and extreme cold. The corridor carries significant freight between major distribution points. Driver fatigue on long hauls, congestion-related rear-end collisions, and weather-related incidents all contribute to accident frequency in this area."
