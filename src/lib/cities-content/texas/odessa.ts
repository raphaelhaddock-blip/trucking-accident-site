  truckingIndustry: `Odessa serves as an important waypoint for oil field hauling in Texas. The city's location on I-10 brings significant 18-wheeler traffic.

Commercial trucks in Odessa operate under tight schedules that can pressure drivers to violate federal hours-of-service regulations. Combined with extreme heat, this creates serious accident risks for local residents.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Odessa are governed by Texas state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: Texas has a 2-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Modified Comparative Negligence**: Texas follows modified comparative negligence with a 51% bar. You can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, with your compensation reduced by your fault percentage. If you are 51% or more at fault, you are barred from recovery.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our Odessa truck accident attorneys understand both Texas law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,

      },
      {
          "question": "What evidence should I gather after a truck accident in Odessa?",
          "answer": "After a truck accident in Odessa, gather as much evidence as possible: photos of all vehicles and the scene, the truck's DOT number and company information, driver information, witness contact details, and the police report number. Seek immediate medical attention and keep all medical records.
