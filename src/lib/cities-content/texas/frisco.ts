  truckingIndustry: `Frisco's economy relies heavily on commercial trucking for Oil and gas transport and Border trade with Mexico. The city's location along I-10 and I-20 makes it a critical logistics hub. Major distribution centers, warehouses, and industrial facilities generate thousands of daily truck trips through Frisco streets and highways.

The Texas trucking industry employs tens of thousands of drivers and supports the state's economy. However, this heavy truck traffic also creates significant accident risks for Frisco residents. Commercial trucks weighing up to 80,000 pounds cause catastrophic injuries when they collide with passenger vehicles.

Frisco sees truck traffic from Agricultural products and Manufacturing. These industries operate on tight delivery schedules that can pressure drivers to violate hours-of-service regulations, skip required rest breaks, and drive while fatigued.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Frisco are governed by Texas state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: Texas sets strict deadlines for filing personal injury and wrongful death claims. Missing this deadline bars your claim forever.

**Comparative Negligence**: Texas's negligence laws determine how fault is allocated and may affect your recovery.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, maintenance, and cargo loading often establish negligence in truck accident cases.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against drivers, carriers, brokers, shippers, and maintenance companies.

Our Frisco truck accident attorneys understand both Texas law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,
