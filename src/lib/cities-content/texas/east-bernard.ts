  truckingIndustry: `Truck traffic in East Bernard stems largely from oil field hauling passing through on I-10. Local residents share roads with these large commercial vehicles.

The Texas trucking industry employs thousands of drivers who transport goods across the state. However, factors including extreme heat, sudden thunderstorms create hazardous conditions. When tired or negligent drivers operate 80,000-pound vehicles in these conditions, catastrophic accidents result.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in East Bernard are governed by Texas state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: Texas has a 2-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Modified Comparative Negligence**: Texas follows modified comparative negligence with a 51% bar. You can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, with your compensation reduced by your fault percentage. If you are 51% or more at fault, you are barred from recovery.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our East Bernard truck accident attorneys understand both Texas law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,

  faqs: [
      {
          "question": "What compensation can I expect from a East Bernard 18-wheeler accident?",
          "answer": "Compensation from an 18-wheeler accident in East Bernard typically includes economic damages (medical bills, lost wages, future medical care, property damage) and non-economic damages (pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life). Commercial trucks carry higher insurance minimums than passenger vehicles, often providing greater recovery potential. Texas's modified-51 system affects how compensation is calculated based on fault allocation."
      },
      {
          "question": "How long does a truck accident case take in East Bernard?",
          "answer": "Truck accident cases in East Bernard generally take between one and three years to resolve. Timeline depends on injury severity, complexity of liability issues, and whether the case settles or goes to trial. Cases involving multiple defendants or catastrophic injuries typically take longer. Your attorney will work to resolve your case efficiently while maximizing your recovery."
      },
      {
          "question": "Can I still recover damages if I was partially at fault for a East Bernard truck accident?",

You can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, with your recovery reduced by your fault percentage. If you are 51% or more at fault, you cannot recover. Insurance companies often try to shift blame to accident victims—experienced attorneys know how to counter these tactics."
      },

The attorney fee is typically a percentage of your recovery, usually 33-40% depending on whether the case settles or goes to trial. This arrangement allows accident victims to access quality legal representation regardless of their financial situation. You should also understand what case costs are covered."

      {
          "question": "Why are truck accidents common on I-10 near East Bernard?",
          "answer": "I-10 near East Bernard sees high truck accident rates due to heavy commercial traffic volume combined with extreme heat and sudden thunderstorms. The corridor carries significant freight between major distribution points. Driver fatigue on long hauls, congestion-related rear-end collisions, and weather-related incidents all contribute to accident frequency in this area."
      },
      {
          "question": "What happens after I hire a East Bernard truck accident lawyer?",
          "answer": "After hiring a truck accident lawyer in East Bernard, your attorney will: send preservation letters to protect evidence, investigate the accident scene and trucking company records, gather medical records and bills, identify all liable parties and insurance coverage, calculate your damages, negotiate with insurance companies, and file a lawsuit if necessary. Most cases settle without trial, but your attorney should be prepared to try your case if needed."
      },
      {
          "question": "What are common injuries in East Bernard truck accidents?",
          "answer": "Truck accidents in East Bernard often cause severe injuries due to the massive size difference between commercial trucks and passenger vehicles. Common injuries include traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord damage, multiple fractures, internal organ damage, burns, and wrongful death. Even 'minor' truck accidents frequently cause long-term injuries requiring extensive medical treatment. The South Central region's extreme heat and sudden thunderstorms contribute to particularly severe accident types."
