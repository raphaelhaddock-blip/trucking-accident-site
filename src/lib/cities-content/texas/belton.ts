  truckingIndustry: `Truck traffic in Belton stems largely from oil field hauling passing through on I-10. Local residents share roads with these large commercial vehicles.

Commercial trucks in Belton operate under tight schedules that can pressure drivers to violate federal hours-of-service regulations. Combined with extreme heat, this creates serious accident risks for local residents.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Belton are governed by Texas state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: Texas has a 2-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Modified Comparative Negligence**: Texas follows modified comparative negligence with a 51% bar. You can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, with your compensation reduced by your fault percentage. If you are 51% or more at fault, you are barred from recovery.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our Belton truck accident attorneys understand both Texas law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,

  faqs: [
      {
          "question": "What compensation can I expect from a Belton 18-wheeler accident?",
          "answer": "Compensation from an 18-wheeler accident in Belton typically includes economic damages (medical bills, lost wages, future medical care, property damage) and non-economic damages (pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life). Commercial trucks carry higher insurance minimums than passenger vehicles, often providing greater recovery potential. Texas's modified-51 system affects how compensation is calculated based on fault allocation."
      },
      {
          "question": "How long does a truck accident case take in Belton?",
          "answer": "Truck accident cases in Belton generally take between one and three years to resolve. Timeline depends on injury severity, complexity of liability issues, and whether the case settles or goes to trial. Cases involving multiple defendants or catastrophic injuries typically take longer. Your attorney will work to resolve your case efficiently while maximizing your recovery."
      },
      {
          "question": "Can I still recover damages if I was partially at fault for a Belton truck accident?",
          "answer": "Yes, but Texas follows modified comparative negligence with a 51% bar. You can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, with your recovery reduced by your fault percentage. If you are 51% or more at fault, you cannot recover. Insurance companies often try to shift blame to accident victims—experienced attorneys know how to counter these tactics."
      },
      {
          "question": "What evidence should I gather after a truck accident in Belton?",
          "answer": "After a truck accident in Belton, gather as much evidence as possible: photos of all vehicles and the scene, the truck's DOT number and company information, driver information, witness contact details, and the police report number. Seek immediate medical attention and keep all medical records. Critical truck evidence like electronic logging device data, dash cam footage, and inspection records must be preserved quickly—your attorney can send a spoliation letter requiring the trucking company to preserve this evidence."
      },
      {
          "question": "Why do I need a truck accident lawyer in Belton?",
          "answer": "Truck accident cases require attorneys who understand both federal trucking regulations and Texas law. Trucking companies have experienced legal teams and insurers who begin building their defense immediately after an accident. A qualified truck accident lawyer knows how to preserve critical evidence, investigate regulatory violations, identify all liable parties, and negotiate with commercial insurers."
      },
      {
          "question": "Why are truck accidents common on I-10 near Belton?",
          "answer": "I-10 near Belton sees high truck accident rates due to heavy commercial traffic volume combined with extreme heat and sudden thunderstorms. The corridor carries significant freight between major distribution points. Driver fatigue on long hauls, congestion-related rear-end collisions, and weather-related incidents all contribute to accident frequency in this area."
