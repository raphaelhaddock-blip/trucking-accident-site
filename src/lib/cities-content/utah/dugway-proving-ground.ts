  truckingIndustry: `Though smaller than major metros, Dugway Proving Ground sits on key trucking routes in Utah. steep grades brings commercial vehicles past residential and commercial areas.

Utah commercial trucks carry goods vital to the economy, but this heavy traffic comes with risks. mountain snow can make already-dangerous truck encounters even more hazardous for passenger vehicles.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Dugway Proving Ground are governed by Utah state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: Utah has a 4-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Modified Comparative Negligence**: Utah uses a modified comparative fault system with a 50% bar. You can recover damages if you were 50% or less at fault, but your recovery is reduced by your fault percentage. If you are found more than 50% responsible, you cannot recover any damages.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our Dugway Proving Ground truck accident attorneys understand both Utah law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,
