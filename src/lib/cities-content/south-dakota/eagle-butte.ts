  truckingIndustry: `Truck traffic in Eagle Butte stems largely from agricultural hauling passing through on I-90. Local residents share roads with these large commercial vehicles.

The South Dakota trucking industry employs thousands of drivers who transport goods across the state. However, factors including severe crosswinds, blizzards create hazardous conditions. When tired or negligent drivers operate 80,000-pound vehicles in these conditions, catastrophic accidents result.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Eagle Butte are governed by South Dakota state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: South Dakota has a 3-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Modified Comparative Negligence**: South Dakota follows modified comparative negligence with a 51% bar. You can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, with your compensation reduced by your fault percentage. If you are 51% or more at fault, you are barred from recovery.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our Eagle Butte truck accident attorneys understand both South Dakota law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,
