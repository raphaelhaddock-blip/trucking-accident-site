  truckingIndustry: `Though smaller than major metros, Lebanon sits on key trucking routes in Indiana. Chicago hub volume brings commercial vehicles past residential and commercial areas.

Commercial trucks in Lebanon operate under tight schedules that can pressure drivers to violate federal hours-of-service regulations. Combined with ice storms, this creates serious accident risks for local residents.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Lebanon are governed by Indiana state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: Indiana has a 2-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Modified Comparative Negligence**: Indiana follows modified comparative negligence with a 51% bar. You can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, with your compensation reduced by your fault percentage. If you are 51% or more at fault, you are barred from recovery.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our Lebanon truck accident attorneys understand both Indiana law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,

          "question": "What is the statute of limitations for truck accident cases in Lebanon, Indiana?",
          "answer": "Indiana has a 2-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. This means you must file your lawsuit within 2 years of the accident date. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be. Evidence preservation is also critical—trucking companies may legally destroy certain records after federal retention periods expire."
      },
      {
          "question": "Who can be held liable for a truck accident in Lebanon?",
          "answer": "Multiple parties may be liable for a Lebanon truck accident: the truck driver, the trucking company, the vehicle owner (if different), the cargo loading company, the maintenance provider, and potentially the truck or parts manufacturer. Federal regulations make trucking companies responsible for their drivers' conduct while operating company vehicles. An investigation will identify all potentially liable parties to maximize your recovery."
      },

          "question": "What insurance covers truck accidents in Lebanon?",
          "answer": "Multiple insurance policies may cover a Lebanon truck accident: the trucking company's liability insurance (federal minimum $750,000-$5 million depending on cargo), the driver's personal insurance, your own uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage, and your health insurance or Med-Pay. An attorney will identify all available coverage sources to maximize your recovery."
      },
      {
          "question": "Why are truck accidents common on I-65 near Lebanon?",
          "answer": "I-65 near Lebanon sees high truck accident rates due to heavy commercial traffic volume combined with ice storms and blizzards. The corridor carries significant freight between major distribution points. Driver fatigue on long hauls, congestion-related rear-end collisions, and weather-related incidents all contribute to accident frequency in this area."
      },
      {
          "question": "Why do I need a truck accident lawyer in Lebanon?",
          "answer": "Truck accident cases require attorneys who understand both federal trucking regulations and Indiana law. Trucking companies have experienced legal teams and insurers who begin building their defense immediately after an accident. A qualified truck accident lawyer knows how to preserve critical evidence, investigate regulatory violations, identify all liable parties, and negotiate with commercial insurers."
      },
      {
          "question": "What are common injuries in Lebanon truck accidents?",
          "answer": "Truck accidents in Lebanon often cause severe injuries due to the massive size difference between commercial trucks and passenger vehicles. Common injuries include traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord damage, multiple fractures, internal organ damage, burns, and wrongful death. Even 'minor' truck accidents frequently cause long-term injuries requiring extensive medical treatment. The Midwest region's ice storms and blizzards contribute to particularly severe accident types."
