  truckingIndustry: `Chesterton's location along I-65 means steady commercial truck traffic despite the city's size. Chicago hub volume keeps 18-wheelers moving through day and night.

Commercial trucks in Chesterton operate under tight schedules that can pressure drivers to violate federal hours-of-service regulations. Combined with ice storms, this creates serious accident risks for local residents.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Chesterton are governed by Indiana state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: Indiana has a 2-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Modified Comparative Negligence**: Indiana follows modified comparative negligence with a 51% bar. You can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, with your compensation reduced by your fault percentage. If you are 51% or more at fault, you are barred from recovery.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our Chesterton truck accident attorneys understand both Indiana law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,

  faqs: [
      {
          "question": "What's the average settlement for Chesterton truck crashes?",
          "answer": "Truck accident settlements in rural areas like Chesterton can be substantial despite lower population density. The Midwest region's unique trucking hazards—ice storms and blizzards—often contribute to severe accidents. While average settlements are difficult to calculate, serious truck accident cases regularly result in six and seven-figure recoveries."
      },
      {
          "question": "How long do I have to file a truck accident lawsuit in Indiana?",
          "answer": "You have 2 years from the accident date to file a truck accident lawsuit in Indiana. However, waiting too long can hurt your case even within this timeframe. Critical evidence like electronic logging device data, dash cam footage, and driver logs may be destroyed or overwritten. Contact an attorney promptly to preserve evidence and protect your rights."
      },
      {
          "question": "Who can be held liable for a truck accident in Chesterton?",
          "answer": "Multiple parties may be liable for a Chesterton truck accident: the truck driver, the trucking company, the vehicle owner (if different), the cargo loading company, the maintenance provider, and potentially the truck or parts manufacturer. Federal regulations make trucking companies responsible for their drivers' conduct while operating company vehicles. An investigation will identify all potentially liable parties to maximize your recovery."
      },
      {
          "question": "What are common injuries in Chesterton truck accidents?",
          "answer": "Truck accidents in Chesterton often cause severe injuries due to the massive size difference between commercial trucks and passenger vehicles. Common injuries include traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord damage, multiple fractures, internal organ damage, burns, and wrongful death. Even 'minor' truck accidents frequently cause long-term injuries requiring extensive medical treatment. The Midwest region's ice storms and blizzards contribute to particularly severe accident types."
      },
      {
          "question": "Why do I need a truck accident lawyer in Chesterton?",
          "answer": "Truck accident cases require attorneys who understand both federal trucking regulations and Indiana law. Trucking companies have experienced legal teams and insurers who begin building their defense immediately after an accident. A qualified truck accident lawyer knows how to preserve critical evidence, investigate regulatory violations, identify all liable parties, and negotiate with commercial insurers."
      },
      {
          "question": "How much does a truck accident lawyer in Chesterton cost?",
          "answer": "Most truck accident lawyers in Chesterton work on a contingency fee basis—you pay nothing upfront and no attorney fees unless you win. The attorney fee is typically a percentage of your recovery, usually 33-40% depending on whether the case settles or goes to trial. This arrangement allows accident victims to access quality legal representation regardless of their financial situation. You should also understand what case costs are covered."
      },
      {
          "question": "What insurance covers truck accidents in Chesterton?",
          "answer": "Multiple insurance policies may cover a Chesterton truck accident: the trucking company's liability insurance (federal minimum $750,000-$5 million depending on cargo), the driver's personal insurance, your own uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage, and your health insurance or Med-Pay. An attorney will identify all available coverage sources to maximize your recovery."
