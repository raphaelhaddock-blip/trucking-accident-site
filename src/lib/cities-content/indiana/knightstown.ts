  truckingIndustry: `Knightstown's location along I-65 means steady commercial truck traffic despite the city's size. Chicago hub volume keeps 18-wheelers moving through day and night.

Commercial trucks in Knightstown operate under tight schedules that can pressure drivers to violate federal hours-of-service regulations. Combined with ice storms, this creates serious accident risks for local residents.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Knightstown are governed by Indiana state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: Indiana has a 2-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Modified Comparative Negligence**: Indiana follows modified comparative negligence with a 51% bar. You can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, with your compensation reduced by your fault percentage. If you are 51% or more at fault, you are barred from recovery.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our Knightstown truck accident attorneys understand both Indiana law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,

          "question": "What's the average settlement for Knightstown truck crashes?",
          "answer": "Truck accident settlements in rural areas like Knightstown can be substantial despite lower population density.

You can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, with your recovery reduced by your fault percentage. If you are 51% or more at fault, you cannot recover. Insurance companies often try to shift blame to accident victims—experienced attorneys know how to counter these tactics."
