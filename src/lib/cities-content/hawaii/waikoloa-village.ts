  truckingIndustry: `Truck traffic in Waikoloa Village stems largely from port traffic passing through on H-1. Local residents share roads with these large commercial vehicles.

The Hawaii trucking industry employs thousands of drivers who transport goods across the state. However, factors including rain, fog create hazardous conditions. When tired or negligent drivers operate 80,000-pound vehicles in these conditions, catastrophic accidents result.`,

  legalInfo: `Truck accident claims in Waikoloa Village are governed by Hawaii state law and federal FMCSA regulations. Key legal considerations include:

**Statute of Limitations**: Hawaii has a 2-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims from truck accidents. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how strong your case may be.

**Modified Comparative Negligence**: Hawaii follows modified comparative negligence with a 51% bar. You can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, with your compensation reduced by your fault percentage. If you are 51% or more at fault, you are barred from recovery.

**Federal Regulations**: FMCSA rules on hours-of-service, drug testing, vehicle maintenance, and cargo securement often establish negligence in truck accident cases. Violations of these federal regulations can be powerful evidence.

**Multiple Defendants**: Trucking accident cases often involve claims against the driver, the trucking company, cargo loading companies, maintenance providers, and sometimes truck or parts manufacturers.

Our Waikoloa Village truck accident attorneys understand both Hawaii law and federal trucking regulations. We investigate accidents thoroughly, preserve critical evidence, and build strong cases for maximum compensation.`,

  faqs: [
      {
          "question": "What compensation can I expect from a Waikoloa Village 18-wheeler accident?",
          "answer": "Compensation from an 18-wheeler accident in Waikoloa Village typically includes economic damages (medical bills, lost wages, future medical care, property damage) and non-economic damages (pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life). Commercial trucks carry higher insurance minimums than passenger vehicles, often providing greater recovery potential. Hawaii's modified-51 system affects how compensation is calculated based on fault allocation."
      },
      {
          "question": "How long does a truck accident case take in Waikoloa Village?",
          "answer": "Truck accident cases in Waikoloa Village generally take between one and three years to resolve.

      {
          "question": "Can I still recover damages if I was partially at fault for a Waikoloa Village truck accident?",

You can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, with your recovery reduced by your fault percentage. If you are 51% or more at fault, you cannot recover. Insurance companies often try to shift blame to accident victims—experienced attorneys know how to counter these tactics."

      {
          "question": "What are common injuries in Waikoloa Village truck accidents?",
          "answer": "Truck accidents in Waikoloa Village often cause severe injuries due to the massive size difference between commercial trucks and passenger vehicles. Common injuries include traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord damage, multiple fractures, internal organ damage, burns, and wrongful death. Even 'minor' truck accidents frequently cause long-term injuries requiring extensive medical treatment. The Pacific region's rain and fog contribute to particularly severe accident types."
      },
      {
          "question": "What happens after I hire a Waikoloa Village truck accident lawyer?",

          "answer": "After a truck accident in Waikoloa Village, gather as much evidence as possible: photos of all vehicles and the scene, the truck's DOT number and company information, driver information, witness contact details, and the police report number. Seek immediate medical attention and keep all medical records. Critical truck evidence like electronic logging device data, dash cam footage, and inspection records must be preserved quickly—your attorney can send a spoliation letter requiring the trucking company to preserve this evidence."
