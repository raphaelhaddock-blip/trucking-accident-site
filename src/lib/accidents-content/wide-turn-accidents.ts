  lastUpdated: '2026-01-10',

  heroText: `Wide turn accidents—often called "right turn squeeze" accidents—occur when semi-trucks making turns crush, sideswipe, or collide with vehicles, pedestrians, or cyclists caught in the space created by the turning maneuver. These accidents are uniquely dangerous because they often trap victims between the turning truck and curbs, barriers, or other obstacles with no escape route.

The physics of turning an 18-wheeler make these accidents a persistent problem. A standard tractor-trailer combination is 70 feet or longer—when making right turns, the trailer follows a tighter path than the tractor, creating a deadly "squeeze zone" on the inside of the turn. Drivers who fail to properly execute wide turns, check mirrors, or yield to traffic in the turn zone cause devastating crashes that trap and crush victims.

Pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists are particularly vulnerable to wide turn accidents. They may be legally positioned in crosswalks, bike lanes, or traffic lanes when a turning truck sweeps into their space without warning. Passenger vehicles can also be caught alongside trucks in turn lanes, crushed against curbs when trucks swing wide.

If you've been injured in a wide turn truck accident, our attorneys understand the specific negligence factors that cause these crashes and will fight for the compensation you deserve.`,

  whatItIs: `A wide turn accident occurs when a semi-truck's turning maneuver causes a collision with vehicles, pedestrians, or cyclists in or near the turn path. These accidents result from the unique handling characteristics of articulated vehicles—the trailer doesn't follow the same path as the tractor, creating dangerous situations that require special driving techniques.

**Understanding Truck Turning Dynamics:**

When any vehicle turns, the rear wheels follow a tighter arc than the front wheels—this is called "off-tracking." For passenger cars, off-tracking is minimal. For a 70-foot tractor-trailer, it can be substantial, with the rear of the trailer tracking several feet inside the tractor's path.

**The Right Turn Squeeze:**

The most common wide turn accident is the "right turn squeeze." To make a right turn without the trailer jumping the curb or hitting obstacles on the inside of the turn, truck drivers must:

1. **Swing Wide Left**: The tractor moves left, sometimes into the adjacent lane, before initiating the turn
2. **Turn Right**: The tractor then turns sharply right while the trailer follows an arc
3. **Complete the Turn**: The trailer swings through the inside of the turn, potentially sweeping across where vehicles or pedestrians were moments before

The danger arises when other road users enter the space created by the driver's initial leftward movement. Seeing the truck move left, a car driver might assume the truck is changing lanes or going straight, moving up alongside on the right—directly into the squeeze zone. When the truck then turns right, the trailer sweeps into the space occupied by the car, crushing it against the curb.

**Left Turn Hazards:**

Left turns also pose risks, though different ones. Trucks making left turns may:
- Swing into oncoming traffic lanes
- Misjudge gaps in crossing traffic
- Strike vehicles in adjacent lanes as the trailer swings wide
- Block multiple lanes during the turn, causing confusion and secondary collisions

**Pedestrian and Cyclist Vulnerability:**

Pedestrians in crosswalks and cyclists in bike lanes face extreme danger from wide turns. They may be legally crossing at an intersection when a turning truck sweeps through their space. The driver, focused on completing the turn, may not see them in the mirrors or may misjudge their position. Once the trailer begins its arc, there's often nowhere for victims to escape.

**The Geometry of Truck Turns:**

Commercial trucks cannot turn like passenger vehicles due to fundamental differences in vehicle geometry. Understanding these differences explains why wide turn accidents occur and why they're so dangerous:

**Wheelbase and Trailer Length:** The distance between the steering axle and rear axles determines the turning path difference between front and rear of the vehicle. Longer combinations create larger differences.

**Off-Tracking:** When a truck turns, the rear wheels follow a tighter path than the front wheels. This is called off-tracking. A 53-foot trailer's rear tracks approximately 6-8 feet inside the tractor's front wheels during a right-angle turn.

**Tail Swing:** While the rear off-tracks to the inside of a turn, the back corner of the trailer swings to the outside. Tail swing can extend 3-4 feet beyond the vehicle's straight-ahead profile.

**Steer Tire Position:** To negotiate tight turns, truck drivers often must swing wide initially, positioning the tractor into adjacent lanes before turning. This creates the dangerous situation where the truck appears to be going straight or changing lanes when actually preparing to turn.

**The Deadly Right Turn Sequence:**

Right turns are particularly dangerous because:

1. The driver must swing the tractor left to position for the turn
2. Vehicles in the right lane see the truck moving left and assume it's changing lanes
3. Vehicles may move alongside the truck on the right
4. The truck then turns right, directly into the path of these vehicles
5. The trailer sweeps across the right lane, striking vehicles that thought they had clearance

Cyclists and motorcyclists are especially vulnerable because they may position themselves in spaces that appear safe but will be swept by the turning trailer.

**Technology Solutions:**

Various technologies can prevent or reduce wide turn accidents:

**Convex Mirrors and Cameras:** Provide better visibility of adjacent vehicles during turns.

**Side Object Detection:** Sensors detect vehicles alongside the truck and warn the driver.

**Turn Warning Signs:** Signs on trailers warning of wide turns alert adjacent drivers.

**Automatic Turn Signals:** Systems that automatically activate turn signals when turns begin.

**Collision Avoidance Systems:** Advanced systems that prevent turns when vehicles are detected alongside.

When carriers fail to implement available technology and wide turn accidents occur, the decision to forgo safety equipment becomes evidence of negligence.

**Wide Turn Accident Statistics:**

Federal data on truck turning accidents reveals:
- Turning movements are involved in approximately 9% of fatal truck crashes
- Right turns account for a disproportionate share of turn-related fatalities
- Pedestrian and cyclist fatalities are overrepresented in turning crashes
- Intersection crashes involving turns have high serious injury rates
- Urban areas see higher rates of wide turn accidents than rural areas

Turn accident contributing factors:
- Failure to check mirrors: 40% of turn accidents
- Inadequate signaling: 30%
- Misjudgment of clearance: 25%
- Failure to yield to vulnerable road users: 20%
- Vision obstruction: 15%`,

    {
      title: 'Failure to Check Mirrors Before Turning',
      description: `The single most common cause of wide turn accidents is drivers failing to adequately check all mirrors before and during the turn. Truck mirrors have significant blind spots, and a quick glance isn't sufficient—drivers must carefully scan each mirror multiple times throughout the turning maneuver. Drivers who are rushed, distracted, or poorly trained may not perform these checks, missing vehicles, pedestrians, or cyclists in the turn zone.`
    },
    {
      title: 'Improper Turning Technique',
      description: `Making safe wide turns requires specific techniques that not all drivers master. Proper technique involves positioning the truck correctly before turning, swinging wide at the right moment, and monitoring all mirrors throughout the maneuver. Drivers who initiate turns too early, swing too wide or not wide enough, or fail to continuously monitor their surroundings cause preventable accidents.`
    },
    {
      title: 'Inadequate Warning to Other Road Users',
      description: `Truck drivers should use turn signals well in advance and position their trucks to clearly indicate their intentions. When drivers signal late, signal in one direction while moving another, or position ambiguously, other road users may misinterpret their intentions. A car driver who sees a truck move left without a right turn signal has no reason to expect the truck will turn right.`
    },
    {
      title: 'Rushing or Schedule Pressure',
      description: `Drivers under pressure to maintain tight delivery schedules may rush through turning maneuvers without adequate care. They may not take time for proper mirror checks, may initiate turns before the intersection is clear, or may squeeze through gaps that require more careful execution. Trucking companies that create unrealistic schedules bear responsibility when their pressure causes accidents.`
    },
    {
      title: 'Driver Inexperience',
      description: `Safe wide turns require skills developed through training and experience. New drivers may not fully understand off-tracking dynamics, may have difficulty judging clearances, or may not have developed effective mirror-checking habits. Carriers that put inexperienced drivers on the road without adequate training share liability for resulting accidents.`
    },
    {
      title: 'Mirror Deficiencies',
      description: `Trucks must be equipped with mirrors that allow drivers to see alongside and behind their trailers. Mirrors that are broken, improperly adjusted, dirty, or missing create blind spots that prevent drivers from seeing vehicles in the turn zone. Carriers have a duty to maintain proper mirror equipment, and drivers must adjust mirrors before operating.`
    },
    {
      title: 'Urban Intersection Challenges',
      description: `City intersections often present particular challenges for truck turns: tight corners, multiple lanes, heavy pedestrian traffic, bike lanes, and parked vehicles. Some intersections may be genuinely difficult for trucks to navigate safely. However, difficulty doesn't excuse negligence—drivers must exercise extreme care in challenging environments or avoid them entirely.`
    },
    {
      title: 'Inadequate Turn Signal Use',
      description: `Drivers who don't signal turns, signal too late, or don't signal sufficiently before beginning turn maneuvers fail to warn adjacent vehicles. When vehicles reasonably believe the truck isn't turning and position themselves alongside, the failure to properly signal establishes driver negligence.`
    },
    {
      title: 'Rushing Through Intersections',
      description: `Proper truck turns require patience and multiple checks. Drivers who rush turns—starting before fully checking mirrors, accelerating through turns, or prioritizing traffic flow over safety—create conditions for wide turn accidents. Time pressure from carriers may encourage dangerous rushing.`
    },
    {
      title: 'Inadequate Driver Training',
      description: `Wide turn execution requires specific techniques taught during CDL training. Drivers who skip training, receive inadequate instruction, or don't practice techniques may not properly execute turns. Carriers who hire undertrained drivers or don't verify training share responsibility.`

    {
      question: 'What is a wide turn truck accident?',
      answer: 'A wide turn accident occurs when a semi-truck making a turn collides with vehicles, pedestrians, or cyclists in or near the turn path. The most common type is the "right turn squeeze," where a truck swings left before turning right, and vehicles or people in the gap on the right side are crushed when the trailer sweeps through that space.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Why do trucks need to make wide turns?',
      answer: 'Tractor-trailers are typically 70+ feet long, and the trailer doesn\'t follow the same path as the tractor—the rear wheels track inside the front wheels (off-tracking). To complete turns without the trailer jumping curbs or hitting obstacles, drivers must swing the tractor wide, then turn sharply. This creates the dangerous "squeeze zone" where accidents occur.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Who is at fault in a wide turn truck accident?',
      answer: 'The truck driver typically bears fault for failing to properly check mirrors, using improper turning technique, or failing to yield to road users in the turn zone. The trucking company may also be liable for inadequate training, schedule pressure, or equipment failures. An investigation determines exactly what negligence caused the crash.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Are pedestrians and cyclists at greater risk in wide turn accidents?',
      answer: 'Yes. Pedestrians in crosswalks and cyclists in bike lanes are extremely vulnerable because they have no protection against being crushed by a turning trailer. They may be legally positioned when the truck begins its turn, then have nowhere to escape as the trailer sweeps through their space. These accidents are often fatal.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What should I do if I see a truck making a wide turn?',
      answer: 'Stay well clear of turning trucks. Never try to pass a truck on the right when it\'s signaling or beginning a turn—even if space appears available. If you\'re on a bicycle or on foot, wait until the truck completely clears the intersection before proceeding. Assume the driver cannot see you.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How can I prove a wide turn accident wasn\'t my fault?',
      answer: 'Evidence is crucial: surveillance footage from nearby businesses, traffic cameras, witness statements, the truck\'s electronic data, and accident reconstruction analysis can establish what happened. An attorney will preserve this evidence before it\'s deleted or lost and investigate the driver\'s training and the carrier\'s practices.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How much compensation can I receive for a wide turn accident injury?',
      answer: 'Compensation depends on injury severity, but wide turn accidents often cause catastrophic injuries—crush injuries, amputations, paralysis—resulting in substantial settlements and verdicts. Medical expenses, lost income, permanent disability, pain and suffering, and wrongful death damages all factor into case value.'
    }
  ,
    {
      question: 'Why do trucks need to swing wide to turn right?',
      answer: 'Truck and trailer combinations cannot pivot around tight corners like cars. The rear wheels track inside the front wheels during turns—a 53-foot trailer\'s rear may track 6-8 feet inside the tractor. To prevent the trailer from jumping curbs or striking corner obstacles, drivers must position the tractor\'s front end wider before turning. This geometry is unavoidable with current trailer designs.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Should I pass a truck on the right when it\'s turning?',
      answer: 'Never. Even if the truck appears to be going left or straight, it may be preparing for a right turn. The area along the right side of a turning truck is called the "death zone" because vehicles there can be swept under the trailer. Always assume a truck may be turning and never position yourself between a truck and a curb at intersections.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Are there truck designs that don\'t require wide turns?',
      answer: 'Shorter trailers require less wide turning, but cargo capacity decreases. Some specialized urban delivery trucks use rear-steering axles that reduce off-tracking. However, standard long-haul combinations will always require wide turns. The focus should be on technology, training, and driver care rather than expecting geometric constraints to disappear.'
