  lastUpdated: '2026-01-10',

  heroText: `When an 80,000-pound semi-truck is controlled by a driver whose eyes are on a phone screen instead of the road, every other motorist is in danger. Distracted driving accidents involving commercial trucks are particularly devastating because of the massive forces involved and because professional drivers should know better—their job is to drive safely, and looking at phones or other distractions while controlling a deadly weapon is inexcusable negligence.

A truck driver who looks at a phone for just 5 seconds at 65 mph travels 477 feet—nearly the length of two football fields—essentially blind. During those seconds, traffic conditions can change completely. Cars can slow or stop. Lanes can merge. Pedestrians can enter crosswalks. By the time the driver looks up, there's no time to react. The laws of physics take over, and people die.

Despite federal regulations banning texting and restricting cell phone use for commercial drivers, distracted driving remains epidemic in the trucking industry. Drivers face pressure to stay in constant contact with dispatchers, manage electronic logging systems, and handle the isolation of long-haul trucking through social connection. These pressures don't excuse the behavior—they explain why it keeps happening and why negligent carriers share responsibility.

If you've been injured by a distracted truck driver, our attorneys understand how to investigate these cases, obtain cell phone records, and prove the driver's attention was somewhere other than the road.`,

  whatItIs: `Distracted driving occurs when a driver diverts attention from the primary task of operating their vehicle. For truck drivers, any distraction is amplified by the difficulty of controlling a large commercial vehicle and the catastrophic consequences when control is lost.

**Types of Distraction:**

**Visual Distraction**: Taking eyes off the road. This includes looking at phones, GPS devices, paperwork, or anything inside or outside the cab that draws visual attention away from driving. Trucks have larger blind spots and require constant visual scanning—any visual distraction creates immediate hazard.

**Manual Distraction**: Taking hands off the wheel. This includes holding phones, eating, reaching for objects, adjusting controls, or any activity that reduces the driver's physical control of the vehicle. Given a truck's size and the forces involved in steering, manual distraction reduces the driver's ability to make corrections.

**Cognitive Distraction**: Taking the mind off driving. This includes conversations (phone or in-person), daydreaming, emotional distress, or complex thinking about non-driving tasks. Even hands-free phone calls create cognitive distraction—the driver's mental attention is on the conversation rather than driving.

**The Most Dangerous Distractions:**

**Texting**: Combines all three types of distraction—visual, manual, and cognitive. Reading or composing a text requires looking at the phone, holding the phone, and thinking about the message content. Texting is banned for commercial drivers under federal law because it's so dangerous.

**Smartphone Use**: Beyond texting, smartphones enable social media, web browsing, email, and apps that can consume attention. Each notification pulls the driver's attention toward the phone. The compulsive nature of smartphone use makes it particularly dangerous for long-haul drivers fighting boredom.

**Dispatch and ELD Devices**: Commercial trucks are equipped with electronic logging devices and dispatch communication systems. While these serve legitimate purposes, interacting with them while driving creates distraction. Carriers that require real-time communication while driving share liability for crashes.

**Eating and Drinking**: Long-haul drivers often eat while driving to save time. Unwrapping food, eating, and dealing with spills all create distraction. Drivers who eat behind the wheel rather than taking proper breaks create unnecessary risk.

**Reaching for Objects**: Dropped items, reaching into bags, or looking for materials in the cab causes visual and manual distraction. The cab of a truck is a workspace for many drivers, filled with items that can become distractions.

**Why Distracted Driving Is Worse in Trucks:**

**Stopping Distance**: Trucks require 300+ feet to stop at highway speed—more than double a passenger vehicle's stopping distance. A distracted driver who doesn't see a hazard until the last moment may have no opportunity to stop, even with emergency braking.

**Size and Weight**: The forces involved when 80,000 pounds strikes another vehicle are tremendous. What might be a minor fender-bender between cars becomes a fatal collision when a truck is involved. Distraction in a truck carries higher consequences.

**Longer Reaction Requirements**: Trucks require more time and space to execute evasive maneuvers. A distracted truck driver who finally sees a hazard may not have time to maneuver even if they could have avoided it with proper attention.

**Hours Behind the Wheel**: Long-haul trucking involves many consecutive hours of driving. The temptation to break monotony with phone use or other distractions is ever-present. Professional drivers must resist these temptations—that's part of the job.

**Commercial Responsibility**: Truck drivers are professionals operating under federal regulations. They're trained, tested, and licensed specifically to operate commercial vehicles safely. Choosing to drive distracted violates their professional obligations and creates liability beyond ordinary negligence.

**Categories of Distraction:**

Driver distraction encompasses three distinct types, all of which are present and amplified in commercial trucking:

**Visual Distraction:** Taking eyes off the road. At highway speeds, looking away for just 3 seconds means traveling the length of a football field without seeing the road. Visual distractions include:
- Checking phones or navigation systems
- Looking at paperwork or load documents
- Watching events outside the truck
- Adjusting mirrors or controls while moving

**Manual Distraction:** Taking hands off the wheel. Commercial trucks require constant steering input due to their size and wind sensitivity. Manual distractions include:
- Holding phones or devices
- Eating and drinking
- Reaching for objects in the cab
- Writing or using paper-based logs
- Adjusting vehicle controls

**Cognitive Distraction:** Taking mental focus off driving. Even with eyes on the road and hands on the wheel, a distracted mind misses hazards. Cognitive distractions include:
- Phone conversations (even hands-free)
- Thinking about personal problems
- Daydreaming or fatigue-induced inattention
- Stress about loads, schedules, or work issues
- Listening to engaging content

**Cell phone use combines all three distraction types**, which is why it's so dangerous and specifically prohibited for commercial drivers.

**The Unique Dangers of Truck Driver Distraction:**

Distraction impacts truck drivers more severely than passenger vehicle drivers:

**Slower Reaction Implementation:** Even when a distracted truck driver perceives danger, the truck's braking distance means more time and distance is needed to stop. Distraction delays perception; truck physics delays stopping. Combined, these create extreme stopping distances.

**Control Difficulty:** Trucks require constant steering attention. Wind gusts, road irregularities, and trailer dynamics demand active control. A distracted driver may not notice lane departure until the truck is already leaving the road.

**Higher Stakes:** When a distracted car driver crashes, they typically damage themselves and one other vehicle. When a distracted truck driver crashes, multiple fatalities often result. The consequences of truck driver distraction are orders of magnitude more severe.

**Longer Hours of Exposure:** Truck drivers spend 11 hours per day operating vehicles. The extended exposure time increases opportunities for distraction and the cumulative effect of multiple minor distractions.

**Distracted Driving Statistics:**

Federal research on truck driver distraction reveals:
- Distraction is a factor in approximately 8% of large truck crashes
- Texting while driving increases crash risk 23-fold
- Reaching for objects increases crash risk 6-fold
- Dialing cell phones increases crash risk 6-fold
- Reading or writing while driving increases crash risk 4-fold

The Virginia Tech Transportation Institute found that taking eyes off the road for 2 seconds doubles crash risk. At 65 mph, 2 seconds equals traveling 190 feet—more than half a football field—blind.

Types of distraction in truck crashes:
- Cell phone use: 25% of distraction crashes
- Operating vehicle controls: 20%
- External distraction: 15%
- Eating/drinking: 10%
- Drowsiness-related inattention: 10%`,

      answer: 'Evidence includes: cell phone records showing calls, texts, or data use at crash time; phone forensic analysis revealing app activity; dashcam footage; witness observations; Event Data Recorder showing no braking; accident reconstruction proving driver had time to react; and carrier dispatch records. An attorney can subpoena phone records and other electronic evidence.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Is texting while driving illegal for truck drivers?',
      answer: 'Yes. Federal regulations (49 CFR 392.82) prohibit commercial motor vehicle drivers from texting while driving. This includes any manual entering of text, reading from devices, or accessing internet. Violations can result in fines, CDL disqualification, and establish clear negligence in crash cases.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can the trucking company be held liable for a distracted driver?',
      answer: 'Yes. Trucking companies can be liable for: failing to enforce cell phone policies, requiring real-time communication while driving, not disciplining drivers for known distraction, using monitoring technology but ignoring alerts, and creating time pressure that encourages distraction. Vicarious liability also applies to employee negligence.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What if the driver claims they weren\'t on their phone?',
      answer: 'Driver denials can be disproven with evidence. Cell phone records show exact timing of calls, texts, and data activity. Phone forensic analysis reveals app usage. Accident reconstruction can prove the driver had time to react—meaning attention was elsewhere. The burden shifts when evidence shows distraction was likely.'

      question: 'How quickly must I act to preserve phone evidence?',
      answer: 'Immediately. Phone records from carriers are retained for limited periods. Phones can be wiped or replaced. Legal preservation demands (spoliation letters) must be sent quickly to prevent evidence destruction. An attorney should be contacted within days of the crash to ensure critical evidence is preserved.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Are hands-free calls legal for truck drivers?',
      answer: 'Yes, with restrictions. Commercial drivers can use mobile phones hands-free if operation requires only a single button push. The phone must be within reach while belted. However, even hands-free calls create cognitive distraction—driver attention is on conversation, not driving. Hands-free use that contributes to crashes may still establish negligence.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What damages are available in distracted driving truck accident cases?',
      answer: 'Damages include medical expenses, lost income, pain and suffering, disability, and wrongful death. Because distracted driving—especially texting—is deliberately dangerous behavior, punitive damages may be available to punish the conduct and deter others. Courts and juries often award significant damages when drivers chose phones over safety.'

    {
      question: 'Is hands-free phone use legal for truck drivers?',
      answer: 'Federal regulations prohibit truck drivers from using hand-held mobile phones while operating commercial vehicles. Hands-free devices are technically legal but research shows hands-free conversations still create significant cognitive distraction. Some carriers prohibit all phone use while driving, including hands-free. Regardless of legality, hands-free use that contributes to crashes can establish negligence.'

    {
      question: 'Can you prove a truck driver was distracted before a crash?',
      answer: 'Yes. Evidence includes: cell phone records showing calls, texts, or data use; ELD and dispatch system logs showing interactions; dashcam footage of driver behavior; event data recorder information showing no braking before impact; witness observations of driver not watching the road; and driver admissions. Expert reconstruction can identify distraction patterns from physical evidence.'
