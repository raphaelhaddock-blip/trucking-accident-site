  metaTitle: 'Rear-Ended by 18-Wheeler Lawyer | Semi-Truck Rear-End Collision Attorney',
  metaDescription: 'Rear-ended by an 18-wheeler? Our attorneys handle rear-end truck collision cases nationwide. Free consultation. No fee unless you win.',

  heroText: `Being rear-ended by an 80,000-pound semi-truck is a terrifying experience that leaves victims with devastating injuries. Unlike typical car-on-car rear-end accidents that might result in minor fender benders, a rear-end collision with an 18-wheeler generates forces that can crush passenger vehicles, rupture fuel tanks, and cause chain-reaction pileups involving multiple vehicles.

The physics are unforgiving. A fully loaded commercial truck traveling at highway speed carries momentum equivalent to roughly 30 passenger cars. When that mass strikes a stopped or slow-moving vehicle from behind, the smaller vehicle has no chance—it becomes crumpled against whatever is in front of it, pushed into intersection traffic, or simply destroyed in place.

Most rear-end truck collisions are entirely preventable. They typically result from truck driver fatigue, distraction, following too closely, or failure to adjust for the massive stopping distances these vehicles require. Federal regulations exist to prevent these crashes, but trucking companies often prioritize profits over safety, pressuring drivers to operate when fatigued and maintaining schedules that don't allow for safe following distances.

If you or a loved one has been rear-ended by a commercial truck, you need experienced attorneys who understand the evidence needed to prove negligence and the full value of your injuries. We fight to hold trucking companies accountable while helping you recover the compensation you deserve.`,

  whatItIs: `A rear-end truck collision occurs when a commercial vehicle—typically a semi-truck, 18-wheeler, or tractor-trailer—strikes the rear of another vehicle. While rear-end collisions are the most common type of traffic accident generally, rear-end crashes involving commercial trucks are disproportionately severe due to the massive weight and momentum involved.

**Understanding Stopping Distances:**

The fundamental issue in rear-end truck collisions is stopping distance. A fully loaded 18-wheeler traveling at 65 mph needs approximately 525 feet to come to a complete stop—nearly two football fields. This breaks down into:

- **Perception Distance**: The distance traveled while the driver recognizes a hazard (approximately 1.5 seconds or 143 feet at 65 mph)
- **Reaction Distance**: The distance traveled while the driver moves from the accelerator to the brake pedal (approximately 0.75 seconds or 71 feet at 65 mph)
- **Braking Distance**: The distance required for the brakes to stop the vehicle (approximately 310 feet at 65 mph for a loaded truck)

Compare this to a passenger car at the same speed, which needs only about 300 feet total stopping distance. This 225-foot difference means that in identical situations, a truck driver who would have stopped safely in a car may instead crash into the vehicle ahead.

**Why Truck Rear-End Collisions Are More Severe:**

Several factors make these crashes particularly devastating:

**Mass and Momentum**: An 80,000-pound truck at highway speed carries enormous momentum. When this strikes a 4,000-pound passenger vehicle, nearly all that energy transfers to the smaller vehicle, causing catastrophic damage.

**Height Differential**: Semi-trucks sit higher than passenger vehicles. In rear-end impacts, the truck's bumper or front structure may override the car's trunk, driving into the passenger compartment where occupants sit. This can lead to underride-type injuries even in rear-end crashes.

**Fuel Risks**: Both the truck and struck vehicle may have fuel systems damaged by impact, creating fire risks. Truck fuel tanks hold up to 300 gallons of diesel; ruptures can cause massive fires.

**Secondary Collisions**: A vehicle struck from behind by a truck may be pushed into oncoming traffic, intersection cross-traffic, other vehicles ahead, or off the roadway. The truck itself may continue forward, striking additional vehicles.

**Crash Dynamics**: Even if the initial impact doesn't breach the passenger compartment, the extreme forces cause severe injuries through deceleration trauma—occupants' internal organs continue moving even as the body is stopped, causing internal bleeding and organ damage.`,

      title: 'Driver Fatigue',
      description: `Fatigue is the leading cause of rear-end truck collisions. Drowsy drivers have delayed reaction times, impaired judgment, and may actually fall asleep at the wheel. A fatigued truck driver approaching slowing traffic may not recognize the hazard or react in time. Despite Hours of Service regulations limiting driving time, fatigue remains endemic—drivers may falsify logs, companies may pressure drivers to continue despite exhaustion, and the demanding nature of trucking disrupts healthy sleep patterns.`
    },
    {
      title: 'Following Too Closely',
      description: `Given their enormous stopping distances, trucks must maintain substantial following distances. The general rule is at least one second of following distance for every 10 feet of vehicle length, plus an additional second for speeds over 40 mph. For a typical 70-foot tractor-trailer at highway speed, this means at least 8 seconds following distance. Many drivers, especially those under schedule pressure, follow far too closely. When traffic suddenly slows, they cannot stop in time.`
    },
    {
      title: 'Distracted Driving',
      description: `Cell phone use, texting, eating, adjusting GPS or dispatch equipment, and other distractions cause truck drivers to take their eyes off the road at critical moments. At highway speed, a driver looking at their phone for just 5 seconds travels 478 feet—almost 500 feet without watching the road. If traffic slows during those 5 seconds, a rear-end collision is nearly inevitable. Federal regulations ban texting and restrict phone use for commercial drivers, but violations are common.`
    },
    {
      title: 'Brake System Failures',
      description: `Commercial truck braking systems are complex, with air brakes, multiple brake drums, and extensive pneumatic systems. Failures can result from inadequate maintenance, worn components, air leaks, or out-of-adjustment brakes. When brakes fail or perform poorly, stopping distances increase dramatically. FMCSA regulations require rigorous brake inspections, but cost-cutting carriers often defer maintenance until equipment fails catastrophically.`
    },
    {
      title: 'Speeding',
      description: `Speed dramatically increases both stopping distance and crash severity. A truck traveling 75 mph instead of 65 mph requires an additional 100+ feet to stop. Higher speed also means more kinetic energy at impact—a 10 mph increase roughly doubles the crash energy. Drivers speeding to meet delivery deadlines may find themselves unable to stop when traffic conditions change.`
    },
    {
      title: 'Adverse Weather Conditions',
      description: `Rain, ice, snow, and fog all increase stopping distances and reduce visibility. FMCSA regulations require drivers to adjust speed and driving behavior for conditions, but many drivers maintain schedule-driven speeds despite hazards. When a driver realizes traffic has stopped on a foggy highway, they may be too close to stop even with maximum braking. Chain-reaction pileups in adverse weather frequently involve trucks rear-ending stopped traffic.`
    },
    {
      title: 'Traffic Congestion Surprises',
      description: `When highway traffic suddenly slows or stops—due to accidents, construction, or rush hour congestion—truck drivers may be caught off guard. The transition from free-flowing traffic to stopped traffic can happen quickly, especially around curves or hills that limit visibility. Drivers who aren't maintaining adequate following distances or who are distracted may not recognize the hazard until collision is unavoidable.`

      question: 'Why do rear-end truck accidents cause such severe injuries?',
      answer: 'An 80,000-pound truck traveling at highway speed carries enormous momentum—roughly equivalent to 30 passenger cars. When this mass strikes a smaller vehicle from behind, nearly all that energy transfers to the struck vehicle, causing catastrophic damage. Additionally, trucks often override smaller vehicles due to height differences, and the forces can push struck vehicles into secondary collisions.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Who is at fault when a truck rear-ends another vehicle?',
      answer: 'The truck driver and trucking company are presumptively at fault. Drivers must maintain safe following distances and attention. Common contributing factors include driver fatigue, distraction, speeding, following too closely, and brake failures. The trucking company may also be liable for inadequate maintenance, pressure to speed, or hiring unqualified drivers.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How much is my rear-end truck accident case worth?',
      answer: 'Values vary significantly based on injury severity, liability strength, and available insurance. Rear-end truck crashes often cause catastrophic injuries resulting in substantial settlements. Factors affecting value include medical expenses, lost wages and earning capacity, pain and suffering, and whether punitive damages apply. An attorney can evaluate your specific case.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What if I was stopped illegally when the truck hit me?',
      answer: 'Even if you were in a position you shouldn\'t have been, the truck driver still had a duty to maintain control and avoid collisions. Most states use comparative negligence, meaning any fault on your part would reduce—but not eliminate—your recovery. Only if you were severely at fault in a contributory negligence state might your recovery be completely barred.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How do truck drivers\' cell phone records help my case?',
      answer: 'Cell phone records showing calls or texts at the time of the crash prove distracted driving. Your attorney can subpoena these records during litigation. If the driver was texting or calling when they hit you, this establishes negligence and violation of federal regulations, significantly strengthening your case and potentially supporting punitive damages.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What does the truck\'s "black box" reveal about the crash?',
      answer: 'The Engine Control Module (ECM) records data including speed, brake application, throttle position, and other parameters in the seconds before a crash. This data can prove the truck was speeding, that the driver didn\'t brake in time, or that there were mechanical issues. Electronic Logging Device data also shows whether the driver was fatigued from excessive hours.'
