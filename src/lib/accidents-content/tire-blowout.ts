  metaDescription: 'Injured in a truck tire blowout accident? Our attorneys investigate tire failures and maintenance negligence. Free consultation. No fee unless you win.',

  heroText: `The explosive failure of a semi-truck tire is one of the most terrifying events on American highways. When an 18-wheeler's tire blows out at highway speed, the consequences can be catastrophic—the truck may swerve violently, debris may strike nearby vehicles, or the driver may lose control entirely. What happens in the seconds after that explosion determines whether people live or die.

Commercial truck tires operate under tremendous stress. Each tire on an 80,000-pound truck may carry 10,000 pounds or more, often while traveling at 65+ mph in extreme heat. The combination of heavy loads, high speeds, and thermal stress pushes tires to their limits. When maintenance is neglected, when tires are run underinflated, or when carriers use worn or defective tires to save money, those tires fail—often without warning.

Tire debris on highways—those black alligators scattered across interstates—tell the story of an epidemic of tire failures. Each piece represents a blowout event. Some cause no harm. Others cause accidents that kill and maim innocent motorists. The randomness of who gets hurt doesn't make it any less preventable.

If you've been injured in a truck tire blowout accident, our attorneys understand how to investigate these cases, prove the tire shouldn't have failed, and hold negligent parties accountable.`,

  whatItIs: `A tire blowout is a rapid loss of tire pressure caused by sudden structural failure of the tire. Unlike slow leaks that gradually deflate tires, blowouts happen explosively—in an instant, the tire goes from holding the vehicle's weight to being shredded rubber flapping against the road or flying off entirely.

**The Mechanics of Tire Blowouts:**

Commercial truck tires are complex structures designed to contain tremendous forces:

**Tire Structure:**
- **Tread**: The outer rubber layer that contacts the road
- **Belts**: Steel or fabric layers beneath the tread that maintain shape
- **Sidewalls**: The vertical rubber connecting tread to bead
- **Beads**: Steel wire rings that seat the tire to the wheel
- **Inner Liner**: Air-tight layer that holds inflation pressure
- **Carcass**: The tire's structural body

**How Blowouts Occur:**

**Underinflation**: The most common cause of truck tire blowouts. When tires are underinflated, sidewalls flex excessively during rotation. This flexing generates heat—lots of it. The heat degrades rubber and weakens structural components. Eventually, the weakened tire fails, often during sustained high-speed operation when heat is greatest.

**Overloading**: Tires have load ratings specifying maximum weight capacity. Exceeding these ratings—whether through vehicle overloading or improper weight distribution—stresses tires beyond design limits. Overloaded tires flex more, heat more, and fail more.

**Road Hazards**: Potholes, debris, and curb strikes can damage tire structure invisibly. The tire may hold air initially but fail later when the damaged area can no longer contain pressure. Impact damage is often missed during inspections.

**Aging and Weathering**: Rubber degrades over time even when tires aren't used. UV exposure, ozone, and chemical breakdown weaken tires. Industry guidance suggests replacing tires after 6-10 years regardless of tread depth, but many trucks run older tires to save money.

**Manufacturing Defects**: Defects in tire construction—poor adhesion between layers, contamination during manufacturing, improper curing—can cause failures even in new tires. Defects may not be visible until the tire comes apart.

**Tread Separation**: The tread can separate from underlying belts, peeling off the tire. This is particularly dangerous because large chunks of tread can strike other vehicles. Tread separation is often caused by heat damage from underinflation.

**What Happens During a Blowout:**

**Steer Tire Blowout**: The most dangerous scenario. When a front steer tire fails, the truck immediately pulls toward that side. The driver must fight to maintain control while the shredded tire creates drag. At highway speed, maintaining control requires immediate, skilled response. Many drivers overcorrect, causing the truck to veer across lanes.

**Drive Tire Blowout**: Drive axle blowouts may cause loss of traction and power delivery issues but are generally more controllable than steer tire failures. However, the exploding tire and flying debris still create hazards.

**Trailer Tire Blowout**: Trailer blowouts may destabilize the trailer, potentially causing sway or jackknife. Debris from trailer tires commonly strikes following vehicles.

**Debris Hazards:**

A blowout creates a debris field. Chunks of rubber, steel belts, and sometimes entire tread sections become projectiles or road obstacles. This debris can:
- Strike following vehicles' windshields, causing driver injury or loss of control
- Be run over by other vehicles, causing them to lose control
- Create obstacles that cause chain-reaction accidents
- Remain on the roadway as ongoing hazards`,

  causes: [
    {
      title: 'Underinflation',
      description: `Running tires below recommended pressure is the leading cause of truck tire blowouts. Underinflated tires flex excessively, generating internal heat that weakens the tire structure. Proper inflation requires daily checks—but many drivers and carriers skip this basic maintenance. FMCSA regulations require specific inflation levels, but compliance is poorly enforced and widely ignored.`
    },
    {
      title: 'Overloading',
      description: `Every tire has a rated load capacity. When trucks are overloaded—whether intentionally to carry more freight or through improper weight distribution—tire loads exceed design limits. Overloaded tires run hotter, wear faster, and fail sooner. Carriers and shippers who overload trucks share liability when tires fail from excessive weight.`
    },
    {
      title: 'Excessive Wear',
      description: `Tread depth requirements exist because worn tires are more likely to fail. As tread wears, the remaining rubber is thinner and weaker. Worn tires generate more heat and are more susceptible to punctures and impact damage. Tires worn beyond legal limits should be replaced—but cost-conscious carriers often keep them in service.`
    },
    {
      title: 'Inadequate Inspection',
      description: `Pre-trip inspections should catch underinflation, visible damage, and excessive wear. Drivers who rush through inspections or skip them entirely miss warning signs. Carriers that don't enforce inspection requirements enable preventable tire failures. Post-trip inspections should catch problems before the next trip, but many carriers don't require them.`
    },
    {
      title: 'Age and Degradation',
      description: `Tire rubber degrades over time through oxidation and UV exposure. Old tires are weaker and more prone to failure even if tread appears adequate. Industry guidelines recommend replacing tires after 6-10 years from manufacture date, but no federal regulation requires this. Many trucks run dangerously old tires to avoid replacement costs.`
    },
    {
      title: 'Improper Repairs',
      description: `Tire repairs must follow industry standards to be safe. Plugs and patches have limitations on size and location. Repairs to sidewalls and certain tread areas are prohibited because they're unreliable. When shops perform improper repairs—or carriers repair tires that should be replaced—failures result.`
    },
    {
      title: 'Defective Tires',
      description: `Manufacturing defects cause some tire failures regardless of maintenance. Defects include: poor adhesion between components, trapped air or contaminants, improper rubber compounds, and curing defects that weaken structure. Defective tires may pass inspection but fail catastrophically in service.`
    },
    {
      title: 'Recap/Retread Failures',
      description: `Retreaded tires—old casings with new tread applied—are common in trucking because they cost less than new tires. But retreads have higher failure rates, particularly if the underlying casing is damaged or the retread process is flawed. Tread separation from retreads creates significant debris hazards.`

    {
      code: '49 CFR 396.17',
      title: 'Annual Inspections',
      description: `Commercial vehicles require annual comprehensive inspections including tire examination. Inspectors must check tread depth, tire condition, and inflation. Vehicles failing inspection cannot operate until defects are corrected. Carriers operating trucks with tire defects after failed inspections demonstrate willful negligence.`

  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'What causes truck tires to blow out?',
      answer: 'The leading causes of truck tire blowouts are underinflation (which causes heat buildup and weakens tire structure), overloading beyond tire capacity, excessive wear, age and degradation, improper repairs, road hazard damage, and manufacturing defects. Most blowouts result from inadequate tire maintenance and inspection.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Who is responsible for a truck tire blowout accident?',
      answer: 'Liability typically falls on the trucking company for failing to properly maintain and inspect tires. Drivers may share liability for failing to conduct required inspections. Tire manufacturers are liable for defective tires. Retread companies may be liable for faulty retreads. Investigation determines which parties\' negligence contributed to the failure.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How can I prove the tire was defective or poorly maintained?',
      answer: 'Evidence includes the failed tire itself (which an expert can analyze), maintenance records, driver inspection reports, tire purchase records, the DOT manufacture date code, and carrier tire policies. Expert examination can determine whether the tire failed from underinflation, defect, wear, or other causes.'
    },
    {
      question: 'I was hit by tire debris but not the truck itself. Can I still sue?',
      answer: 'Yes. If you were injured by tire debris from a blowout, the parties responsible for maintaining that tire are liable for your injuries. This includes being struck directly by debris, or crashing while swerving to avoid debris. The truck operator\'s negligent tire maintenance caused your harm regardless of whether the truck itself hit you.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Why are retread tires dangerous?',
      answer: 'Retreads—old tire casings with new tread applied—have higher failure rates than new tires. The retreading process may not adequately bond to damaged casings. Underlying casing damage may not be detected. When retreads fail, tread often separates entirely, creating large debris hazards. Retreads are banned from steer axles due to safety concerns.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How long do I have to file a lawsuit after a tire blowout accident?',
      answer: 'Statutes of limitations vary by state, typically 2-4 years. However, tire evidence must be preserved immediately—tires can be disposed of or tampered with quickly. Product liability claims against tire manufacturers may have different deadlines. Contact an attorney immediately to ensure evidence is preserved and deadlines are met.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What compensation is available for tire blowout accident injuries?',
      answer: 'Compensation includes medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, permanent disability, disfigurement, and property damage. Fatal accidents allow wrongful death claims. When carriers knowingly operated on unsafe tires, punitive damages may be available. The specific amount depends on injury severity and the evidence of negligence.'
