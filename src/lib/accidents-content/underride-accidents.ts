  heroText: `Underride accidents are among the most horrific events on American roadways. These crashes occur when a passenger vehicle slides underneath the rear or side of a semi-truck trailer, often shearing off the top of the smaller vehicle at windshield height. The results are almost invariably catastrophic—decapitation, severe head trauma, and death are tragically common outcomes.

What makes underride accidents particularly devastating is that they are largely preventable. Federal regulations have required rear underride guards on trailers since 1953, yet these guards frequently fail in real-world crashes because the standards are outdated and inadequate. Side underride guards, which could prevent the most common type of underride crash, are not even required under federal law—despite proven technology existing for decades.

If you or a loved one has been devastated by an underride truck accident, you need attorneys who understand the technical failures that allow these crashes to occur and who will fight to hold trucking companies and trailer manufacturers accountable for putting inadequate safety equipment on our roads. We pursue maximum compensation while advocating for the regulatory changes needed to prevent future tragedies.`,

  whatItIs: `An underride accident occurs when a smaller vehicle—typically a passenger car, motorcycle, or SUV—slides underneath the body of a semi-truck trailer. Because standard trailer bodies ride 4 to 5 feet above the ground (to accommodate varying terrain and loading dock heights), there is a significant gap between the bottom of the trailer and the roadway.

When a vehicle enters this gap, the trailer's hard edge typically strikes at windshield height, bypassing the vehicle's designed crash protection entirely. Modern cars are engineered to protect occupants in frontal and side impacts through crumple zones, airbags, and reinforced passenger compartments. But none of these systems help when the impact point is above the hood—the collision energy goes directly into the passenger compartment, often at the level of occupants' heads.

**Types of Underride Accidents:**

**Rear Underride**: These occur when a vehicle strikes the back of a trailer, sliding underneath from behind. This can happen when: a truck stops suddenly in traffic, a car fails to stop in time, a truck is parked or disabled on the roadway without adequate warning, or poor visibility conditions (fog, darkness, rain) prevent drivers from seeing a slow-moving or stopped truck. Rear underride guards are federally mandated but often fail in real-world crashes.

**Side Underride**: These are the most common and often deadliest type of underride accident. They occur when a vehicle strikes the side of a trailer, typically at intersections when a truck is crossing traffic, making a turn, or traveling in an adjacent lane. No federal requirement exists for side underride guards, leaving the full length of most trailers completely unprotected.

**Front Underride**: Less common, these occur when a truck's front overrides a smaller vehicle from above, typically in aggressive rear-end or head-on collisions where the truck mounts the smaller vehicle. The truck's front bumper and cab structure can crush down onto a passenger vehicle's roof.

**The Science of Underride Protection:**

Effective underride guards work by engaging the crashing vehicle's crash structures—primarily the engine block and frame rails—preventing it from sliding underneath and directing crash energy into systems designed to absorb it. For rear guards, this means a rigid barrier that extends low enough and strong enough to catch the front of impacting vehicles. For side guards, rigid or energy-absorbing panels fill the gap between trailer wheels.

The technology to prevent underride deaths exists and has been proven. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) has tested underride guards extensively, rating many as "Good" performers that successfully prevent underride in 35 mph crashes. Yet weaker guards—rated "Poor" or "Marginal"—remain legal and common, and side guards are entirely optional. This gap between available safety technology and actual requirements has cost thousands of lives.

**Understanding Underride Crash Mechanics:**

Underride crashes occur when a passenger vehicle slides under a truck's trailer or rear end, typically shearing off the roof of the car and killing or seriously injuring occupants. Understanding the mechanics explains why these crashes are so deadly and often preventable.

**Why Underride Occurs:**

The height differential between passenger vehicles and commercial trucks creates the underride hazard. Passenger car bumpers typically sit 16-20 inches above the ground. Trailer floors and rear frames sit 30-50 inches high. When a passenger vehicle strikes a trailer's side or rear, the car's hood and bumper pass under the trailer frame, and the trailer floor impacts the windshield and roof.

**Types of Underride Crashes:**

**Rear Underride:** A passenger vehicle strikes the rear of a trailer or straight truck, sliding underneath. This typically occurs in rear-end collisions when trucks are stopped, slowing, or moving more slowly than traffic.

**Side Underride:** A passenger vehicle slides under the side of a trailer. This occurs when: trucks make wide turns, trucks are struck broadside at intersections, trucks change lanes into vehicles, or passenger vehicles strike the sides of trailers crossing intersections.

**The Lethality Factor:**

Underride crashes have extremely high fatality rates because:

**Passenger Compartment Intrusion:** The trailer floor directly impacts the windshield, dashboard, and roof—the passenger compartment itself. Unlike frontal crashes where the engine compartment absorbs energy, underride crashes bypass the entire front structure.

**Roof Shearing:** Vehicle roofs are not designed to withstand the forces and geometry of underride impacts. The rigid trailer floor acts like a guillotine, shearing through the roof structure.

**Restraint System Bypass:** Airbags and seatbelts are designed for frontal forces. In underride crashes, the threat comes from above and in front simultaneously—a direction these systems cannot address.

**High Relative Speed:** Underride crashes often involve significant speed differential. A car traveling 65 mph striking a stopped or slow-moving trailer creates extremely violent impact dynamics.

**Underride Guard Technology:**

Guards are designed to prevent vehicle underride by providing an impact surface that engages passenger vehicle bumpers:

**Rear Underride Guards:** Federal regulations require rear underride guards on trailers, but current standards are inadequate. Existing standards allow guards that fail in moderate-speed crashes. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) has developed stronger standards that some manufacturers voluntarily meet.

**Side Underride Guards:** No federal requirement exists for side underride guards on trailers. These guards, common in Europe, prevent the side underride crashes that kill hundreds annually. Legislation has been proposed but not enacted.

**Front Underride Guards:** Tractor front ends lack underride protection requirements. When tractors strike passenger vehicles, override (the opposite of underride) can occur, with similar lethality.

**Underride Crash Statistics:**

Federal research on underride crashes reveals:
- Approximately 400-500 people die annually in underride crashes with large trucks
- Side underride accounts for roughly half of underride fatalities
- Rear underride guard failures are factors in many rear underride deaths
- Nighttime crashes disproportionately involve underride due to visibility issues
- Underride fatality rates far exceed overall truck crash fatality rates

Underride crash factors:
- Inadequate or absent underride guards: 70% of underride deaths
- Visibility/conspicuity failures: 40% of nighttime underride crashes
- Speed of passenger vehicle: Higher speeds correlate with guard failure
- Guard mounting failures: Some guards detach on impact
- Side underride without guards: Nearly all side underride deaths`,

      title: 'Truck Stopping or Slowing Suddenly',
      description: `When a semi-truck stops suddenly in traffic—due to congestion, an obstacle, or the driver's error—following vehicles may not have time to stop. If the truck's brake lights are dim, dirty, or malfunctioning, the danger increases dramatically. Rear underride often follows. While following too closely contributes to some cases, the lack of adequate underride guards means even reasonable following distances can be insufficient to prevent underride when trucks stop unexpectedly.`

    {
      title: 'Inadequate Trailer Lighting and Reflective Tape',
      description: `Many underride accidents occur in low-visibility conditions when drivers cannot see a slow-moving or stopped trailer until it's too late. Federal regulations require reflective tape on trailers, but the requirements are minimal and compliance is inconsistent. Dirty, damaged, or inadequate reflective material can render a trailer nearly invisible at night or in fog. When poor visibility combines with inadequate underride protection, fatal crashes result.`
    },
    {
      title: 'Truck Crossing Traffic at Intersections',
      description: `Side underride crashes frequently occur when trucks pull across traffic at intersections or driveways. A truck crossing multiple lanes presents its full 53-foot length to crossing traffic. If the truck misjudges the gap, traffic speeds faster than expected, or another driver fails to yield, vehicles can strike the trailer's unprotected side. Without side underride guards, there's nothing to prevent vehicles from sliding underneath.`
    },
    {
      title: 'Disabled or Parked Trucks on Roadways',
      description: `When trucks break down or must stop on roadways, they create severe underride hazards—especially at night or in limited visibility. Federal regulations require specific warning devices (reflective triangles, emergency flashers), but these are often inadequate or improperly deployed. Drivers who encounter a dark trailer blocking their lane at highway speed have almost no chance of avoiding rear underride without effective guards.`

    {
      title: 'Failure of Existing Underride Guards',
      description: `Many rear underride guards simply fail in crashes. The federal standard (established in 1998 and only slightly updated since) requires guards to withstand just 50% of the force of a common crash scenario. In IIHS testing, many guards rated "Poor" or "Marginal" bend, break, or detach entirely at impact speeds that occur routinely in traffic. When guards fail, underride follows despite their presence.`
    },
    {
      title: 'Absence of Side Underride Guards',
      description: `The single greatest factor enabling side underride deaths is the complete absence of federal requirements for side guards. This regulatory gap exists despite proven technology, documented lives saved in countries where guards are required, and decades of advocacy by safety organizations. Trucking industry lobbying has blocked proposed requirements, leaving most trailers with unprotected sides.`
    },
    {
      title: 'Inadequate Rear Guard Standards',
      description: `Current federal rear underride guard standards (set in 1998 and updated in 2017) remain inadequate. Guards that meet minimum requirements may still fail in crashes at moderate speeds. Carriers using guards that meet only minimum standards—rather than stronger IIHS-recommended standards—bear responsibility when inadequate guards contribute to fatalities.`
    },
    {
      title: 'Absence of Side Underride Guards',
      description: `Without federal side guard requirements, most trailers lack any side underride protection. Side underride kills approximately 200 people annually—deaths largely preventable with guards common in other countries. Carriers' decisions not to voluntarily install side guards become evidence of negligence when side underride deaths occur.`
    },
    {
      title: 'Reflective Tape and Visibility Failures',
      description: `Trucks must display reflective tape to make their sides and rears visible at night. When tape is missing, damaged, or inadequate, other drivers may not see stopped or slow-moving trucks until too late to avoid underride crashes. Visibility failures are common factors in nighttime underride crashes.`

  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'What is an underride truck accident?',
      answer: 'An underride accident occurs when a smaller vehicle slides underneath a semi-truck trailer. Because trailers ride 4-5 feet above the ground, a vehicle entering this gap strikes the trailer edge at windshield height, bypassing the car\'s crash protection systems. These accidents cause severe head trauma, decapitation, and death at rates far exceeding other crash types.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Why don\'t trucks have side underride guards?',
      answer: 'Despite proven technology and mandatory requirements in Europe, the U.S. does not require side underride guards. The trucking industry has lobbied against proposed requirements, citing cost and weight concerns. Safety advocates and affected families continue pushing for federal requirements, but as of now, side guards remain optional. Some safety-conscious fleets voluntarily install them.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Are rear underride guards effective?',
      answer: 'It depends on the guard. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety tests rear guards and rates them from "Poor" to "Good." Guards rated "Good" successfully prevent underride in 35 mph crash tests. However, many guards on the road rate "Poor" or "Marginal" and fail in the same tests—bending, breaking, or detaching. Federal standards allow these inadequate guards to be installed legally.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I sue the trailer manufacturer for an underride crash?',
      answer: 'Yes. Product liability claims against trailer manufacturers increasingly succeed on theories that trailers without effective underride protection are defectively designed. When superior protection technology exists but wasn\'t implemented, manufacturers may be held strictly liable for resulting injuries. Your attorney can evaluate whether a product liability claim applies to your case.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How much is an underride accident case worth?',
      answer: 'Underride cases typically involve catastrophic or fatal injuries, resulting in substantial settlements and verdicts. Values depend on injury severity, victim\'s age and earning capacity, strength of liability evidence, and applicable insurance coverage. Many underride cases settle for seven figures; some result in multi-million dollar verdicts. Each case must be evaluated individually.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the STOP Underrides Act?',
      answer: 'The Stop Underrides Act is proposed federal legislation that would require side underride guards on new trailers and strengthen rear guard requirements. It has been introduced multiple times but has not yet passed. The act is named in honor of underride victims and is supported by safety advocates, families of victims, and some trucking industry members.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How long do I have to file an underride accident lawsuit?',
      answer: 'Statutes of limitations vary by state, typically 2-4 years for personal injury and wrongful death claims. However, evidence crucial to underride cases—including the trailer, underride guard, and electronic data—may be destroyed or lost if not preserved quickly. Contact an attorney immediately to ensure evidence is secured and your rights are protected within applicable deadlines.'
    }
  ,
    {
      question: 'Why don\'t all trucks have side underride guards?',
      answer: 'The trucking industry has resisted mandatory side guards, citing cost, weight penalties affecting cargo capacity, and questions about effectiveness. However, side guards are required in Europe and have proven effective at preventing side underride deaths. Currently, carriers can voluntarily install side guards, but most don\'t. When carriers skip available safety equipment and side underride crashes occur, cost-cutting decisions become evidence of negligence.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How effective are rear underride guards?',
      answer: 'Effectiveness depends on guard strength. Guards meeting only minimum federal standards may fail in crashes at speeds as low as 35 mph. Guards built to IIHS TOUGHGUARD standards prevent underride in 35 mph crashes. When carriers install guards that exceed minimum requirements, underride prevention is significantly improved. Choosing minimum-compliance guards over stronger alternatives is a knowable choice that affects crash outcomes.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Are underride crashes survivable?',
      answer: 'Underride crashes at significant speed are almost never survivable without effective guards. The crash mechanism bypasses all vehicle safety systems. With proper guards that prevent underride, crashes become conventional impacts where airbags and crumple zones function as designed. The presence or absence of effective guards determines whether occupants have any chance of survival.'
