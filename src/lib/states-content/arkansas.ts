  heroText: `Arkansas's position as a central freight crossroads and home to Walmart's global headquarters creates significant commercial truck traffic on state highways. With over 80 people killed annually in collisions involving large trucks, Arkansas roadways see devastating accidents regularly.

The Arkansas trucking industry is uniquely shaped by the state's role as Walmart's home base. The Bentonville-based retail giant operates one of the world's largest private trucking fleets, and thousands of supplier trucks travel Arkansas highways daily to serve Walmart distribution centers. Over 65,000 commercial trucks are registered in the state.

Major corridors including I-40, I-30, I-55, and I-49 carry enormous freight volumes, connecting Memphis to Oklahoma City, Dallas to Little Rock, and serving the massive logistics network centered in Northwest Arkansas.

Arkansas follows modified comparative negligence with a 50% bar, meaning you can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, but recovery is barred if you are more than 50% at fault. The state has a three-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims.

If you've been injured in an Arkansas truck accident, our Arkansas truck accident lawyers know how to preserve evidence, investigate thoroughly, and hold negligent carriers accountable under both federal FMCSA regulations and Arkansas state law.`,

    description: 'Arkansas follows modified comparative negligence with a 50% bar. You can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, but recovery is barred if you are more than 50% at fault.',
    details: `Under Arkansas's modified comparative fault rule, your damages are reduced by your percentage of fault. If you are found 50% or less at fault, you can recover damages. However, if you are found more than 50% at fault, you recover nothing. For example, if you suffered $1,000,000 in damages and were 30% at fault, you could recover $700,000. But if you were 51% at fault, you would recover nothing. This makes establishing the trucking company's primary fault critical in contested cases. Insurance adjusters often try to shift blame to victims—an experienced Arkansas truck accident lawyer knows how to prove the truck driver and carrier were primarily responsible.`

This means you must file your lawsuit within three years of the accident date. Wrongful death claims also have a three-year deadline. Missing these deadlines typically bars your claim forever, so it's important to contact an attorney promptly after any serious truck accident. Evidence preservation is also time-sensitive—trucking companies may legally destroy certain records after required retention periods.`

  courtInfo: `Truck accident cases in Arkansas may be filed in state circuit courts or federal courts depending on the parties involved and amounts in controversy. Cases against trucking companies often involve defendants from multiple states, potentially qualifying for federal court under diversity jurisdiction if the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.

Arkansas state courts follow the Arkansas Rules of Civil Procedure, which include specific provisions for discovery that can be crucial in trucking cases. Arkansas allows discovery of corporate defendants, including depositions of company representatives, production of safety records, and inspection of vehicles and maintenance facilities.

Venue rules in Arkansas generally allow cases to be filed where the accident occurred, where the defendant resides or has its principal office, or where the plaintiff resides. Pulaski County (Little Rock), Washington County (Northwest Arkansas), and Benton County (Bentonville) handle many truck accident cases.

The Eastern and Western Districts of Arkansas federal courts hear trucking cases. Given Arkansas's concentration of retail distribution trucking, the courts have significant experience with commercial vehicle litigation.`,

  whyHireLocal: `Arkansas truck accident cases require attorneys who understand both federal FMCSA regulations and the nuances of Arkansas state law.

An Arkansas truck accident lawyer also understands the state's unique trucking infrastructure, dominated by the Walmart distribution network and agricultural hauling. They know the dangerous corridors, understand the retail supply chain trucking patterns, and can investigate accidents involving the many carriers operating throughout Arkansas.

Many major trucking companies and retail carriers operate extensively in Arkansas. Experienced local attorneys know these companies, their safety records, and how to effectively pursue claims against them in Arkansas courts.`,
