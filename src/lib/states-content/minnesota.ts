  heroText: `Minnesota's position as a major distribution hub for the Upper Midwest and gateway to the Pacific Northwest creates significant commercial truck traffic on state highways. With over 70 people killed annually in collisions involving large trucks, Minnesota roadways see devastating accidents.

The Minnesota trucking industry handles substantial freight volumes. Over 90,000 commercial trucks are registered in the state, operating on corridors connecting the Twin Cities to Duluth, Chicago, and the Pacific Northwest. Minneapolis-St. Paul serves as a major distribution center hub for retailers and manufacturers.

Minnesota's harsh winter conditions create particularly dangerous trucking conditions. Heavy snow, ice, extreme cold, and limited visibility contribute to serious truck accidents. The I-94 corridor from Wisconsin through the Twin Cities to North Dakota is a critical freight route facing these challenges.

Minnesota follows modified comparative negligence with a 51% bar, meaning you can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, but recovery is barred if you are 51% or more at fault. The state has a six-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims.

If you've been injured in a Minnesota truck accident, our Minnesota truck accident lawyers know how to preserve evidence, investigate thoroughly, and hold negligent carriers accountable.`,

  courtInfo: `Truck accident cases in Minnesota may be filed in state district courts or federal courts depending on the parties involved and amounts in controversy. Cases against trucking companies often involve defendants from multiple states, potentially qualifying for federal court under diversity jurisdiction if the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.

Minnesota state courts follow the Minnesota Rules of Civil Procedure. Minnesota allows discovery of corporate defendants, including depositions of company representatives, production of safety records, and inspection of vehicles and maintenance facilities.

Venue rules in Minnesota generally allow cases to be filed where the accident occurred, where the defendant resides or has its principal office, or where the plaintiff resides. Hennepin County (Minneapolis), Ramsey County (St. Paul), and Dakota County handle many truck accident cases.

The District of Minnesota federal court handles trucking cases involving out-of-state defendants.`,
