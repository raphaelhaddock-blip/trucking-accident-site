  heroText: `North Dakota presents unique challenges for commercial trucking operations and significant risks for motorists sharing the roads with 18-wheelers. With 25+ people killed annually in collisions involving large trucks, North Dakota sees its share of devastating commercial vehicle accidents. The state's 50,000+ registered commercial trucks operate on highways that face extreme cold and oil field traffic, creating conditions that contribute to serious and fatal crashes.

The North Dakota trucking industry serves critical economic functions. Oil and gas, Agriculture, Energy, Food processing, Manufacturing all depend heavily on reliable freight transportation. Major trucking corridors including Interstate 94, Interstate 29, US Route 2, US Route 85 carry commercial traffic through diverse terrain and weather conditions. Both local delivery operations and long-haul carriers traverse these routes daily, creating ongoing accident risks for North Dakota motorists.

North Dakota follows modified comparative negligence with a 50% bar for personal injury cases. You can recover damages if you are 49% or less at fault, but recovery is barred if you are 50% or more at fault. The state has a 6 years statute of limitations for personal injury claims, meaning you must file suit within 6 years of the accident. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of injury severity.

Weather plays a significant role in North Dakota truck accidents. During October, November, December, January, February, March, April, extreme cold and oil field traffic creates particularly hazardous conditions for commercial vehicles. Large trucks require significantly longer stopping distances than passenger vehicles, and challenging conditions magnify this disadvantage. When trucking companies pressure drivers to maintain schedules despite dangerous conditions, preventable accidents occur.

If you have been injured in a North Dakota truck accident, time is critical. Trucking companies dispatch investigation teams immediately after serious crashes to protect their interests. Evidence including electronic logging device data, driver records, and maintenance logs may be overwritten or destroyed if not preserved quickly. Our North Dakota truck accident lawyers know how to preserve evidence, investigate thoroughly, and hold negligent carriers accountable under both federal FMCSA regulations and North Dakota state law.`,

Commercial trucks traveling this route face unique challenges including variable weather conditions, terrain changes, and mixing with local traffic. North Dakota State Patrol conducts regular enforcement operations along this corridor, and truck accidents here often involve complex liability determinations due to the mix of interstate and local carriers. The combination of heavy truck volumes and extreme cold and oil field traffic makes this route particularly hazardous during October, November, December.`

    description: 'North Dakota follows modified comparative negligence with a 50% bar. You can recover damages if you are 49% or less at fault, but recovery is barred if you are 50% or more at fault.',
    details: `Under North Dakota law, your damages are reduced by your percentage of fault, and recovery is barred if you exceed the threshold. For example, if you suffered $1,000,000 in damages but were 30% at fault, you could recover $700,000. However, if a jury finds you 50% or more responsible for the accident, you recover nothing.

This rule makes establishing the trucking company's greater fault critical in contested cases. Insurance adjusters often try to shift blame to victims to reduce or eliminate their responsibility. They may claim you were speeding, failed to yield, or were distracted—anything to increase your percentage of fault. An experienced North Dakota truck accident lawyer knows how to counter these tactics through thorough investigation and evidence preservation.

Electronic logging device data, driver qualification files, maintenance records, and the carrier's safety history all help establish the trucking company's negligence. Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration regulations set minimum standards, and violations frequently appear in accident investigations. When carriers cut corners on safety to increase profits, North Dakota law holds them accountable.`

  statuteOfLimitations: {
    personalInjury: '6 Years',
    wrongfulDeath: '2 Years',
    propertyDamage: '6 Years',
    details: `North Dakota has a 6 years statute of limitations for personal injury claims and 2 years for wrongful death claims. Property damage claims must be filed within 6 years. These deadlines are strictly enforced—missing the deadline by even one day typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how serious your injuries are or how clear the trucking company's fault.

The deadline may be extended in limited circumstances, such as when the victim was a minor or legally incapacitated at the time of the accident. However, waiting to file is always risky. Evidence disappears, witnesses move or forget details, and trucking companies may legally destroy records after federal retention periods expire.

Beyond the legal deadline, practical considerations favor prompt action. Electronic logging device data may be overwritten. Driver employment records become harder to obtain. Witnesses' memories fade. Physical evidence from the scene is cleaned up or altered. The sooner your attorney can investigate and preserve evidence, the stronger your case will be.

Contact an attorney promptly after any serious North Dakota truck accident to protect your rights and ensure critical evidence is preserved before it is lost or destroyed.`

  courtInfo: `Truck accident cases in North Dakota may be filed in state courts or federal courts depending on the parties involved and amounts in controversy. North Dakota state courts follow state procedural rules and apply North Dakota substantive law. The District of North Dakota federal court handles cases involving diversity jurisdiction (parties from different states with amounts exceeding $75,000) or federal questions.

North Dakota state courts offer multiple venues depending on where the accident occurred and where defendants are located. Generally, cases may be filed where the accident occurred, where the defendant resides or has its principal office, or where a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim occurred. Choosing the right venue can impact case outcomes based on local jury pools and judicial tendencies.

Both state and federal courts in North Dakota allow broad discovery in trucking cases. This includes depositions of company representatives, production of driver qualification files and safety records, and inspection of vehicles and maintenance facilities. Electronic data from trucks' black boxes and ELD systems can be obtained through proper discovery procedures.

North Dakota does not cap economic damages in personal injury cases, allowing full recovery of medical expenses, lost wages, future medical costs, and other financial losses. Non-economic damages (pain and suffering) may be subject to certain limitations depending on the circumstances. Punitive damages are available in cases involving egregious misconduct, though caps may apply.`,

  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'What is the statute of limitations for truck accident cases in North Dakota?',
      answer: 'North Dakota has a 6 years statute of limitations for personal injury claims and 2 years for wrongful death claims from truck accidents. This means you must file your lawsuit within 6 years of the accident date for personal injury or 2 years of the death for wrongful death. Missing this deadline typically bars your claim forever, regardless of how serious your injuries are. Property damage claims have a 6 years deadline. It is important to contact an attorney promptly after any serious truck accident to ensure your rights are protected and evidence is preserved.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I still recover damages if I was partially at fault for a North Dakota truck accident?',
      answer: 'North Dakota follows modified comparative negligence with a 50% bar. You can recover damages if you are 49% or less at fault, but recovery is barred if you are 50% or more at fault. For example, if you suffered $1,000,000 in damages but were found 20% at fault, your recovery would be reduced to $800,000. This makes establishing the trucking company\'s primary fault critical in contested cases. Insurance adjusters often try to shift blame to accident victims to reduce or eliminate their responsibility. An experienced North Dakota truck accident lawyer knows how to counter these tactics and prove the truck driver and carrier were primarily at fault through evidence including electronic logging device data, driver qualification files, and maintenance records.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What damages can I recover in a North Dakota truck accident case?',
      answer: 'North Dakota allows recovery of both economic damages (medical expenses, lost wages, property damage, future medical costs, lost earning capacity) and non-economic damages (pain and suffering, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, loss of consortium). Economic damages compensate for actual financial losses and are typically proven through medical bills, wage statements, and expert testimony about future costs. Non-economic damages compensate for intangible losses and vary based on injury severity and impact on daily life. Punitive damages may be available in cases involving gross negligence, reckless conduct, or intentional misconduct by the trucking company or driver.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How long do trucking companies have to keep records in North Dakota?',
      answer: 'Federal regulations require trucking companies to retain driver qualification files for three years after employment ends, hours of service records for six months, vehicle maintenance records for one year plus the time the equipment is in use, and accident registers for three years. However, companies often destroy records as soon as legally permitted—sometimes even sooner. This is why prompt legal action after a truck accident is critical. An experienced North Dakota truck accident attorney can send preservation letters requiring the trucking company to retain all evidence related to your case, preventing destruction of potentially crucial evidence.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What evidence is important in a North Dakota truck accident case?',
      answer: 'Critical evidence in North Dakota truck accident cases includes electronic logging device (ELD) data showing driver hours and rest periods, the truck\'s electronic control module (ECM) or black box data capturing speed, braking, and other operational parameters, driver qualification files showing training and driving history, maintenance records revealing any deferred repairs or safety issues, dispatch records showing pressure to meet delivery deadlines, toxicology results from post-accident drug and alcohol testing, and the carrier\'s safety rating and inspection history from FMCSA databases. Physical evidence from the scene, witness statements, and surveillance or dashcam video are also valuable. Time is critical—much of this evidence can be legally destroyed or overwritten if not preserved quickly.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I sue an out-of-state trucking company for a North Dakota accident?',
      answer: 'Yes. If a truck accident occurs in North Dakota, North Dakota courts generally have jurisdiction over the case regardless of where the trucking company is headquartered. The company, by operating on North Dakota highways, subjects itself to North Dakota jurisdiction. Your case may be filed in North Dakota state court or in federal court (the District of North Dakota). Federal court may be appropriate when the case involves parties from different states and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. Your attorney can advise on the best venue for your specific situation based on factors including the defendant\'s location, available evidence, and local court practices.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What if the truck driver who caused my accident was an independent contractor?',
      answer: 'Trucking companies often try to avoid liability by classifying drivers as independent contractors rather than employees. However, North Dakota courts look at the actual relationship—not just what the contract says—to determine whether the trucking company controlled the driver\'s work. Even with true independent contractors, the trucking company may be liable under theories including negligent hiring (failing to properly screen the driver), negligent supervision (failing to ensure compliance with safety regulations), or negligent entrustment (allowing an unqualified driver to operate the truck). The motor carrier may also be directly liable for violations of federal safety regulations that apply regardless of driver classification.'
