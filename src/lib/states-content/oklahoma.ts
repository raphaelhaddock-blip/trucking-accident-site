  heroText: `Oklahoma's position as a central freight crossroads connecting Texas to the Midwest and the East Coast to the West creates significant commercial truck traffic on state highways. With over 95 people killed annually in collisions involving large trucks, Oklahoma roadways see devastating accidents regularly.

The Oklahoma trucking industry is substantial, with over 75,000 registered commercial trucks operating on corridors connecting Texas markets to Kansas City, and carrying freight along historic Route 66 and modern interstate highways. I-40, I-44, and I-35 carry enormous freight volumes through the state.

Oklahoma's energy industry adds specialized trucking hazards. Oil field equipment, drilling materials, and petroleum products travel Oklahoma highways constantly, creating unique accident scenarios involving oversized loads and hazardous materials.

Oklahoma follows modified comparative negligence with a 51% bar, meaning you can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, but recovery is barred if you are 51% or more at fault. The state has a two-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims.

If you've been injured in an Oklahoma truck accident, time is critical. Our Oklahoma truck accident lawyers know how to preserve evidence, investigate thoroughly, and hold negligent carriers accountable under both federal FMCSA regulations and Oklahoma state law.`,

    description: 'Oklahoma follows modified comparative negligence with a 51% bar. You can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, but recovery is barred if you are 51% or more at fault.',
    details: `Under Oklahoma's modified comparative negligence rule, your damages are reduced by your percentage of fault. If you are found 50% or less at fault, you can recover damages. However, if you are found 51% or more at fault, you recover nothing. For example, if you suffered $1,000,000 in damages and were 30% at fault, you could recover $700,000. But if you were 51% at fault, you would recover nothing. This makes establishing the trucking company's primary fault critical in contested cases. Insurance adjusters often try to shift blame to victims—an experienced Oklahoma truck accident lawyer knows how to prove the truck driver and carrier were primarily responsible.`

Evidence preservation is also time-sensitive—trucking companies may legally destroy certain records after required retention periods.`

  courtInfo: `Truck accident cases in Oklahoma may be filed in state district courts or federal courts depending on the parties involved and amounts in controversy. Cases against trucking companies often involve defendants from multiple states, potentially qualifying for federal court under diversity jurisdiction if the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.

Oklahoma state courts follow the Oklahoma District Court Rules, which include specific provisions for discovery that can be crucial in trucking cases. Oklahoma allows discovery of corporate defendants, including depositions of company representatives, production of safety records, and inspection of vehicles and maintenance facilities.

Venue rules in Oklahoma generally allow cases to be filed where the accident occurred, where the defendant resides or has its principal office, or where the plaintiff resides. Oklahoma County (Oklahoma City) and Tulsa County handle many truck accident cases due to their metropolitan court systems.

The Northern, Eastern, and Western Districts of Oklahoma federal courts hear trucking cases. Oklahoma courts have experience with commercial vehicle litigation given the state's position as a major freight corridor.`,

  whyHireLocal: `Oklahoma truck accident cases require attorneys who understand both federal FMCSA regulations and the nuances of Oklahoma state law. Local counsel knows the Oklahoma court system, local procedures, and the judges who will hear your case. They understand how Oklahoma juries evaluate trucking company negligence and what evidence resonates with local fact-finders.

Oklahoma's modified comparative negligence rules mean that fault allocation is critical to your recovery. Experienced local attorneys know how to minimize victim fault and maximize trucking company responsibility, keeping your fault percentage below the 51% bar that would eliminate your recovery.

An Oklahoma truck accident lawyer also understands the state's trucking infrastructure, including the energy industry traffic, turnpike system, and the major interstate crossroads that concentrate truck traffic in Oklahoma. They know the dangerous corridors and can investigate accidents involving carriers operating on Oklahoma highways.

Oklahoma's oil and gas industry creates specialized trucking hazards that local attorneys understand. Oversized equipment, hazmat transport, and oilfield operations require specific expertise that experienced Oklahoma truck accident lawyers can provide.`,
