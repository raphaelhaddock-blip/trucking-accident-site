  heroText: `Tennessee ranks ninth in the nation for truck accident fatalities, with approximately 150 people killed annually in collisions involving large commercial vehicles. The Volunteer State's position at the crossroads of the Southeast creates massive trucking volumes, with major interstates converging through Memphis and Nashville.

Memphis is one of America's premier logistics hubs. FedEx's global headquarters and main sorting facility process millions of packages daily, generating constant truck traffic. The Port of Memphis on the Mississippi River adds barge-to-truck transfers. Interstate 40 runs coast-to-coast through Nashville and Memphis, carrying transcontinental freight across the state every hour of every day.

Nashville has experienced explosive growth, and with that growth comes increased trucking demand. Distribution centers ring the metropolitan area. Amazon, Walmart, and other major shippers have established significant operations in Middle Tennessee. The construction boom requires constant materials transport on already congested highways.

Tennessee law provides important protections for truck accident victims. The state follows modified comparative negligence with a 50% bar—meaning you can recover damages if you're less than 50% at fault. Understanding Tennessee's one-year statute of limitations and state-specific requirements is essential for protecting your rights.`,

  courtInfo: `Tennessee truck accident cases may be filed in state Circuit Courts or federal courts. Federal jurisdiction exists for diversity cases exceeding $75,000 with parties from different states—common when out-of-state trucking companies cause Tennessee accidents.

Tennessee Circuit Courts have general civil jurisdiction. Venue is proper in the county where the accident occurred or where the defendant resides. Tennessee has three federal judicial districts (Eastern, Middle, and Western) handling cases based on geographic location.

Tennessee allows comprehensive civil discovery. The state's Rules of Civil Procedure govern litigation. Expert testimony on trucking standards and accident reconstruction is permitted. Tennessee courts handle significant trucking litigation given the state's role as a freight hub.

Tennessee's one-year statute of limitations means prompt action is essential. Evidence preservation letters must be sent immediately, and investigation must begin quickly to meet the tight deadline.`,

  whyHireLocal: `Tennessee's one-year statute of limitations makes prompt local legal action essential. This is one of the shortest deadlines in the nation, leaving little time to investigate, gather evidence, and file suit. An experienced Tennessee attorney knows how to move quickly while building a strong case.

Tennessee's logistics-driven economy means local attorneys regularly handle cases involving FedEx, Amazon, and other major shippers with operations in the state. Understanding these companies' practices and finding evidence requires familiarity with Tennessee's trucking environment.

The state's modified comparative negligence rule requires careful case construction. Insurance companies try to push victim fault to the 50% threshold. Local counsel knows how to counter these tactics in Tennessee courts.

Court familiarity matters in Tennessee. From Davidson County Circuit Court in Nashville to Shelby County in Memphis, knowing local procedures and judicial tendencies affects outcomes. Tennessee attorneys understand how to present trucking cases effectively to local juries.`,
