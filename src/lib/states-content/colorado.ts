  heroText: `Colorado's position as a mountain gateway between the plains and the West creates uniquely dangerous trucking conditions. With over 75 people killed annually in collisions involving large trucks, Colorado's mountain passes and highways see devastating accidents.

The Colorado trucking industry faces challenges unlike any other state. Over 85,000 commercial trucks are registered in Colorado, operating on corridors that include some of the most treacherous terrain in North America. The Eisenhower Tunnel on I-70, at 11,158 feet elevation, presents extreme challenges for commercial vehicles.

Mountain grades create particular hazards. The notorious I-70 corridor through the Rocky Mountains features grades exceeding 6%, where brake failures and runaway trucks cause catastrophic accidents. Winter conditions add ice, snow, and limited visibility to already dangerous mountain passes.

Colorado follows modified comparative negligence with a 50% bar, meaning you can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, but recovery is barred if you are more than 50% at fault. The state has a two-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims.

If you've been injured in a Colorado truck accident, our Colorado truck accident lawyers know how to preserve evidence, investigate mountain-terrain accidents, and hold negligent carriers accountable.`,

  courtInfo: `Truck accident cases in Colorado may be filed in state district courts or federal courts depending on the parties involved and amounts in controversy. Cases against trucking companies often involve defendants from multiple states, potentially qualifying for federal court under diversity jurisdiction if the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.

Colorado state courts follow the Colorado Rules of Civil Procedure. Colorado allows discovery of corporate defendants, including depositions of company representatives, production of safety records, and inspection of vehicles and maintenance facilities.

Venue rules in Colorado generally allow cases to be filed where the accident occurred, where the defendant resides or has its principal office, or where the plaintiff resides. Denver County, Arapahoe County, and El Paso County (Colorado Springs) handle many truck accident cases.

The District of Colorado federal court handles trucking cases involving out-of-state defendants.`,

They know how altitude, grades, and weather conditions contribute to accidents and can investigate cases involving these factors. They also understand the specific FMCSA requirements for mountain operations.`,
