  heroText: `Wisconsin's position as a critical link between Chicago and Minneapolis and its substantial manufacturing economy creates significant commercial truck traffic on state highways. With over 80 people killed annually in collisions involving large trucks, Wisconsin roadways see devastating accidents regularly.

The Wisconsin trucking industry handles substantial freight volumes. Over 95,000 commercial trucks are registered in the state, operating on corridors connecting Milwaukee to Minneapolis, Chicago to Green Bay, and serving the state's paper, dairy, and manufacturing industries.

Wisconsin's seasonal challenges create unique trucking hazards. Harsh winters with heavy snow, ice, and limited visibility contribute to serious truck accidents. The state's extensive paper industry in the Fox Valley region generates heavy truck traffic, and dairy operations require constant refrigerated transport.

Wisconsin follows modified comparative negligence with a 51% bar, meaning you can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, but recovery is barred if you are 51% or more at fault. The state has a three-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims.

If you've been injured in a Wisconsin truck accident, our Wisconsin truck accident lawyers know how to preserve evidence, investigate thoroughly, and hold negligent carriers accountable.`,

    description: 'Wisconsin follows modified comparative negligence with a 51% bar. You can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, but recovery is barred if you are 51% or more at fault.',
    details: `Under Wisconsin's modified comparative negligence rule, your damages are reduced by your percentage of fault. If you are found 50% or less at fault, you can recover damages. However, if you are found 51% or more at fault, you recover nothing. For example, if you suffered $1,000,000 in damages and were 30% at fault, you could recover $700,000. But if a jury finds you 51% responsible, you recover nothing. This makes establishing the trucking company's greater fault critical in contested cases.`

  courtInfo: `Truck accident cases in Wisconsin may be filed in state circuit courts or federal courts depending on the parties involved and amounts in controversy. Cases against trucking companies often involve defendants from multiple states, potentially qualifying for federal court under diversity jurisdiction if the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.

Wisconsin state courts follow the Wisconsin Statutes and Supreme Court Rules for civil procedure. Wisconsin allows discovery of corporate defendants, including depositions of company representatives, production of safety records, and inspection of vehicles and maintenance facilities.

Venue rules in Wisconsin generally allow cases to be filed where the accident occurred, where the defendant resides or has its principal office, or where the plaintiff resides. Milwaukee County, Dane County (Madison), and Brown County (Green Bay) handle many truck accident cases.

The Eastern and Western Districts of Wisconsin federal courts hear trucking cases involving out-of-state defendants.`,

A Wisconsin truck accident lawyer also understands the state's unique challenges—harsh winters, heavy manufacturing and paper industry traffic, and the corridors connecting major Midwest markets. They know how weather conditions contribute to accidents and can investigate cases involving these factors effectively.`,
