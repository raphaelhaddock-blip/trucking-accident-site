  heroText: `Arizona's position as a major gateway between California ports and the rest of the nation, combined with substantial Mexican border crossings, creates intense commercial truck traffic on state highways. With over 130 people killed annually in collisions involving large trucks, Arizona roadways see devastating accidents regularly.

The Arizona trucking industry is substantial, with over 95,000 registered commercial trucks operating on corridors connecting Los Angeles and Long Beach ports to Phoenix, Tucson, and points east. I-10 and I-40 carry enormous freight volumes, while I-17 serves as the primary link between these major east-west routes.

Arizona's border with Mexico adds unique trucking challenges. Over 5,000 commercial trucks cross Arizona border ports daily, carrying freight from Mexican manufacturing facilities. The Nogales and San Luis crossings funnel significant truck traffic onto Arizona highways, creating additional congestion and accident potential.

Extreme desert heat creates mechanical challenges for trucks, with tire blowouts and brake failures more common in summer months. Remote stretches of highway mean delayed emergency response when accidents occur, increasing the severity of injuries.

Arizona follows pure comparative negligence, allowing you to recover damages even if you were mostly at fault. However, Arizona has a shorter two-year statute of limitations, making prompt legal action essential after any truck accident.`,

    details: `Under Arizona's pure comparative negligence system, your damages are reduced by your percentage of fault, but you can still recover even if you were mostly at fault for the accident. For example, if you suffered $1,000,000 in damages but were 70% at fault, you could still recover $300,000. This is one of the most plaintiff-friendly systems in the nation, allowing truck accident victims to pursue claims even in contested fault situations. Insurance adjusters may try to exaggerate your fault to reduce their payout—an experienced Arizona truck accident lawyer knows how to counter these tactics.`

  courtInfo: `Truck accident cases in Arizona may be filed in state Superior Court or federal courts depending on the parties involved and amounts in controversy. Cases against trucking companies often involve defendants from multiple states, potentially qualifying for federal court under diversity jurisdiction if the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.

Arizona state courts follow the Arizona Rules of Civil Procedure, which include specific provisions for discovery that can be crucial in trucking cases. Arizona allows discovery of corporate defendants, including depositions of company representatives, production of safety records, and inspection of vehicles and maintenance facilities.

Venue rules in Arizona generally allow cases to be filed where the accident occurred, where the defendant resides or has its principal office, or where the plaintiff resides. Maricopa County (Phoenix area) handles many truck accident cases due to the volume of commercial traffic in the region.

The District of Arizona federal court, with locations in Phoenix and Tucson, hears many trucking cases involving out-of-state defendants. Federal judges in Arizona are experienced with complex commercial transportation litigation.`,

  whyHireLocal: `Arizona truck accident cases require attorneys who understand both federal FMCSA regulations and the nuances of Arizona state law. Local counsel knows the Arizona court system, local procedures, and the judges who will hear your case. They understand how Arizona juries evaluate trucking company negligence and what evidence resonates with local fact-finders.

Arizona's pure comparative negligence rules mean you can recover damages even if partially at fault—but experienced local attorneys know how to maximize trucking company responsibility and minimize victim fault allocation.

An Arizona truck accident lawyer also understands the state's unique trucking infrastructure. They know the dangerous corridors, understand border crossing operations, and can investigate accidents involving Mexican carriers. This local knowledge helps build stronger cases and anticipate defenses specific to Arizona trucking operations.

Arizona's extreme heat and desert conditions create unique mechanical challenges for trucks. Local attorneys understand how tire blowouts, brake failures, and other heat-related issues contribute to accidents and can effectively investigate these cases.`,
