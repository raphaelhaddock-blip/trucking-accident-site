  heroText: `Virginia's position as a critical East Coast freight corridor creates significant commercial truck traffic on state highways. With over 100 people killed annually in collisions involving large trucks, Virginia roadways see devastating accidents regularly.

The Virginia trucking industry handles massive freight volumes. Over 130,000 commercial trucks are registered in the Commonwealth, operating on corridors connecting the Port of Virginia to inland markets and carrying freight along the busy I-95 and I-81 corridors.

The Port of Virginia ranks as the third-largest container port on the East Coast, generating enormous truck traffic. I-81 through the Shenandoah Valley has become one of the most heavily traveled truck corridors in the nation as carriers avoid congested I-95 through Washington, D.C.

CRITICAL WARNING: Virginia is one of only four states that still follows contributory negligence. Under this harsh rule, if you are found even 1% at fault for the accident, you may be completely barred from recovering any damages. This makes Virginia one of the most challenging states for truck accident victims and makes experienced legal representation essential.

If you've been injured in a Virginia truck accident, time is critical. Virginia has a two-year statute of limitations, and proving you had zero fault requires immediate evidence preservation.`,

Under this rule, if you are found even 1% at fault for the accident, you may be completely barred from recovering any damages. This makes Virginia one of the most challenging states for truck accident victims. However, there are exceptions—such as when the defendant's conduct was willful or wanton, or when the last clear chance doctrine applies. Because of this harsh rule, trucking companies and their insurers aggressively try to find any evidence of victim fault. An experienced Virginia truck accident lawyer understands how to overcome these defenses and prove the trucking company's sole responsibility.`

  courtInfo: `Truck accident cases in Virginia may be filed in state circuit courts or federal courts depending on the parties involved and amounts in controversy. Cases against trucking companies often involve defendants from multiple states, potentially qualifying for federal court under diversity jurisdiction if the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.

Virginia state courts follow the Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia, which include specific provisions for discovery in personal injury cases. Virginia allows discovery of corporate defendants, including depositions of company representatives, production of safety records, and inspection of vehicles and maintenance facilities.

Venue rules in Virginia generally allow cases to be filed where the accident occurred, where the defendant resides or has its principal office, or in certain other locations. Fairfax County, Virginia Beach, and Richmond handle many truck accident cases.

The Eastern and Western Districts of Virginia federal courts hear trucking cases. Given Virginia's contributory negligence rule, forum selection can significantly impact case outcomes.`,

  whyHireLocal: `Virginia truck accident cases require attorneys who understand both federal FMCSA regulations and the critical nuances of Virginia's contributory negligence rule. Local counsel knows how to overcome this harsh defense and prove the trucking company was entirely at fault.

Virginia's contributory negligence rule presents unique challenges. Because even 1% fault can bar recovery, it's essential to work with attorneys who know how to overcome this defense and prove the trucking company's sole responsibility. Experienced Virginia attorneys understand the exceptions—wanton conduct, last clear chance doctrine—and know how to present cases to avoid the contributory negligence bar.

A Virginia truck accident lawyer also understands the state's trucking infrastructure, including the Port of Virginia operations, the dangerous I-81 corridor, and Northern Virginia's congested highways. They know how Virginia juries evaluate trucking company negligence and what evidence resonates with local fact-finders.`,
