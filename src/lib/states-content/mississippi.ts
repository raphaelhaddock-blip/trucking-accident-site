  heroText: `Mississippi's position as a north-south freight corridor along the Mississippi River and east-west connector between the Gulf Coast and major southeastern markets creates significant commercial truck traffic. With over 90 people killed annually in collisions involving large trucks, Mississippi highways see devastating accidents regularly.

The Mississippi trucking industry serves critical logistics functions. Over 55,000 commercial trucks are registered in the state, operating on corridors connecting Memphis to New Orleans, Atlanta to Dallas, and serving agricultural, manufacturing, and port-related freight throughout the region.

The Mississippi River ports and Gulf Coast access add significant truck traffic to state highways. Freight from Gulfport and Pascagoula ports travels I-10 and connects to I-55 and I-20 for distribution throughout the nation. Agricultural commodities from the Mississippi Delta region require extensive trucking services.

Mississippi follows pure comparative negligence, allowing you to recover damages even if you were mostly at fault. The state has a three-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims, providing reasonable time to pursue your case—though prompt action is still advisable to preserve evidence.

If you've been injured in a Mississippi truck accident, our Mississippi truck accident lawyers know how to preserve evidence, investigate thoroughly, and hold negligent carriers accountable under both federal FMCSA regulations and Mississippi state law.`,

  courtInfo: `Truck accident cases in Mississippi may be filed in state circuit courts or federal courts depending on the parties involved and amounts in controversy. Cases against trucking companies often involve defendants from multiple states, potentially qualifying for federal court under diversity jurisdiction if the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.

Mississippi state courts follow the Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure, which include specific provisions for discovery that can be crucial in trucking cases. Mississippi allows discovery of corporate defendants, including depositions of company representatives, production of safety records, and inspection of vehicles and maintenance facilities.

Venue rules in Mississippi generally allow cases to be filed where the accident occurred, where the defendant resides or has its principal office, or where the plaintiff resides. Hinds County (Jackson), Harrison County (Gulf Coast), and DeSoto County (Memphis suburbs) handle many truck accident cases.

The Northern and Southern Districts of Mississippi federal courts hear trucking cases. Mississippi courts have significant experience with commercial vehicle litigation given the state's position as a freight corridor.`,
