  heroText: `Kentucky's position as a critical north-south freight corridor connecting the Midwest to the Southeast makes it a heavily trafficked trucking state. With over 110 people killed annually in collisions involving large trucks, Kentucky roadways see devastating commercial vehicle accidents regularly.

The Kentucky trucking industry is substantial, with over 90,000 registered commercial trucks operating on corridors connecting Cincinnati, Louisville, and Lexington to markets throughout the region. I-75, I-65, I-64, and I-71 carry enormous freight volumes through the Commonwealth.

Louisville's position as home to UPS Worldport—the largest automated package handling facility in the world—creates unique trucking dynamics. Thousands of trucks fan out from Louisville daily, connecting air freight to ground delivery throughout the nation. This concentration of logistics activity makes Kentucky highways particularly busy with commercial vehicles.

Kentucky follows pure comparative negligence, allowing you to recover damages even if you were mostly at fault. However, KENTUCKY HAS A VERY SHORT STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS—only one year for personal injury claims. This makes immediate legal action essential after any truck accident.

If you've been injured in a Kentucky truck accident, time is extremely critical. Our Kentucky truck accident lawyers know how to preserve evidence, investigate thoroughly, and hold negligent carriers accountable under both federal FMCSA regulations and Kentucky state law.`,

  courtInfo: `Truck accident cases in Kentucky may be filed in state circuit courts or federal courts depending on the parties involved and amounts in controversy. Cases against trucking companies often involve defendants from multiple states, potentially qualifying for federal court under diversity jurisdiction if the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.

Kentucky state courts follow the Kentucky Rules of Civil Procedure, which include specific provisions for discovery that can be crucial in trucking cases. Kentucky allows discovery of corporate defendants, including depositions of company representatives, production of safety records, and inspection of vehicles and maintenance facilities.

Venue rules in Kentucky generally allow cases to be filed where the accident occurred, where the defendant resides or has its principal office, or where the plaintiff resides. Jefferson County (Louisville), Fayette County (Lexington), and Kenton County (Northern Kentucky) handle many truck accident cases.

The Eastern and Western Districts of Kentucky federal courts hear trucking cases. Given Kentucky's short statute of limitations, prompt filing and experienced counsel are essential.`,

  whyHireLocal: `Kentucky truck accident cases require attorneys who understand both federal FMCSA regulations and the nuances of Kentucky state law. Local counsel knows the Kentucky court system, local procedures, and the judges who will hear your case. They understand how Kentucky juries evaluate trucking company negligence and what evidence resonates with local fact-finders.

Kentucky's one-year statute of limitations makes immediate action essential. Experienced Kentucky attorneys know how to move quickly to preserve evidence, send preservation letters, and protect your rights before the deadline passes.

Kentucky's pure comparative fault rules mean you can recover damages even if partially at fault—but experienced local attorneys know how to maximize trucking company responsibility and minimize victim fault allocation.

A Kentucky truck accident lawyer also understands the state's unique trucking infrastructure, including the massive UPS Worldport operations in Louisville, the coal trucking industry in eastern Kentucky, and the north-south freight corridors that cross the Commonwealth. This local knowledge helps build stronger cases and anticipate defenses specific to Kentucky trucking operations.`,
