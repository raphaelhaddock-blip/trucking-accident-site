  heroText: `South Carolina's position as a major East Coast freight corridor and home to one of the nation's busiest container ports creates significant commercial truck traffic on state highways. With over 95 people killed annually in collisions involving large trucks, South Carolina roadways see devastating accidents regularly.

The South Carolina trucking industry handles substantial freight volumes. Over 70,000 commercial trucks are registered in the state, operating on corridors connecting the Port of Charleston to inland distribution centers and carrying freight between Florida and the Northeast along the I-95 corridor.

The Port of Charleston ranks among the top container ports on the East Coast, generating thousands of truck trips daily. The Inland Port in Greer extends the port's reach, with trucks carrying containers to and from the BMW manufacturing facility and other Upstate industries.

South Carolina follows modified comparative negligence with a 51% bar, meaning you can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, but recovery is barred if you are 51% or more at fault. The state has a three-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims.

If you've been injured in a South Carolina truck accident, our South Carolina truck accident lawyers know how to preserve evidence, investigate thoroughly, and hold negligent carriers accountable under both federal FMCSA regulations and South Carolina state law.`,

    description: 'South Carolina follows modified comparative negligence with a 51% bar. You can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, but recovery is barred if you are 51% or more at fault.',
    details: `Under South Carolina's modified comparative negligence rule, your damages are reduced by your percentage of fault. If you are found 50% or less at fault, you can recover damages. However, if you are found 51% or more at fault, you recover nothing. For example, if you suffered $1,000,000 in damages and were 30% at fault, you could recover $700,000. But if a jury finds you 51% responsible, you recover nothing. This makes establishing the trucking company's greater fault critical in contested cases. Insurance adjusters often try to shift blame to victims to reduce or eliminate their responsibility—an experienced South Carolina truck accident lawyer knows how to counter these tactics.`

  courtInfo: `Truck accident cases in South Carolina may be filed in state circuit courts or federal courts depending on the parties involved and amounts in controversy. Cases against trucking companies often involve defendants from multiple states, potentially qualifying for federal court under diversity jurisdiction if the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.

South Carolina state courts follow the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, which include specific provisions for discovery that can be crucial in trucking cases. South Carolina allows discovery of corporate defendants, including depositions of company representatives, production of safety records, and inspection of vehicles and maintenance facilities.

Venue rules in South Carolina generally allow cases to be filed where the accident occurred, where the defendant resides or has its principal office, or where the plaintiff resides. Charleston County, Greenville County, and Richland County (Columbia) handle many truck accident cases.

The District of South Carolina federal court, with divisions in Charleston, Columbia, Florence, and Greenville, hears trucking cases involving out-of-state defendants.`,

  whyHireLocal: `South Carolina truck accident cases require attorneys who understand both federal FMCSA regulations and the nuances of South Carolina state law. Local counsel knows the South Carolina court system, local procedures, and the judges who will hear your case. They understand how South Carolina juries evaluate trucking company negligence and what evidence resonates with local fact-finders.

South Carolina's modified comparative negligence rules mean that fault allocation is critical to your recovery. Experienced local attorneys know how to minimize victim fault and maximize trucking company responsibility, keeping your fault percentage below the 51% bar that would eliminate your recovery.

A South Carolina truck accident lawyer also understands the state's trucking infrastructure, including the Port of Charleston operations, I-95 corridor traffic, and the manufacturing-related trucking in the Upstate. They know the dangerous corridors and can investigate accidents involving carriers operating on South Carolina highways.`,
