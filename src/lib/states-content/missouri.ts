  heroText: `Missouri's central location makes it a critical crossroads for American freight transportation. With over 120 people killed annually in collisions involving large trucks, Missouri's position at the intersection of major east-west and north-south trucking corridors creates dangerous conditions on state highways.

The Missouri trucking industry is substantial, with over 140,000 registered commercial trucks operating on the state's extensive highway network. Kansas City and St. Louis serve as major distribution hubs, with I-70, I-44, I-55, and I-29 carrying enormous freight volumes through the state.

Missouri's unique geographic position means trucks travel through the state whether heading east to the Atlantic, west to the Pacific, north to Canada, or south to the Gulf. This crossroads effect concentrates commercial traffic on Missouri highways and creates conditions for serious truck accidents.

Missouri follows pure comparative negligence, allowing you to recover damages even if you were mostly at fault. The state also has a generous five-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims, providing more time to pursue your case—though prompt action is still advisable to preserve evidence.

If you've been injured in a Missouri truck accident, our Missouri truck accident lawyers know how to preserve evidence, investigate thoroughly, and hold negligent carriers accountable under both federal FMCSA regulations and Missouri state law.`,

  courtInfo: `Truck accident cases in Missouri may be filed in state circuit courts or federal courts depending on the parties involved and amounts in controversy. Cases against trucking companies often involve defendants from multiple states, potentially qualifying for federal court under diversity jurisdiction if the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.

Missouri state courts follow the Missouri Rules of Civil Procedure, which include specific provisions for discovery that can be crucial in trucking cases. Missouri allows discovery of corporate defendants, including depositions of company representatives, production of safety records, and inspection of vehicles and maintenance facilities.

Venue rules in Missouri generally allow cases to be filed where the accident occurred, where the defendant resides or has its principal office, or where the plaintiff resides. St. Louis City and Jackson County (Kansas City) handle many truck accident cases due to their position as major metropolitan courts.

The Eastern and Western Districts of Missouri federal courts handle significant trucking litigation. Kansas City and St. Louis-based federal judges are experienced with complex commercial transportation cases involving interstate carriers.`,

  whyHireLocal: `Missouri truck accident cases require attorneys who understand both federal FMCSA regulations and the nuances of Missouri state law. Local counsel knows the Missouri court system, local procedures, and the judges who will hear your case. They understand how Missouri juries evaluate trucking company negligence and what evidence resonates with local fact-finders.

Missouri's pure comparative negligence rules mean you can recover damages even if partially at fault—but experienced local attorneys know how to maximize trucking company responsibility and minimize victim fault allocation.

A Missouri truck accident lawyer also understands the state's critical position as a national freight crossroads. They know the dangerous corridors, understand the unique traffic patterns created by Missouri's central location, and can investigate accidents involving carriers from across the nation. This local knowledge helps build stronger cases and anticipate defenses specific to Missouri trucking operations.

Missouri's five-year statute of limitations provides more time than most states, but evidence preservation remains critical. Experienced Missouri attorneys move quickly to preserve trucking company records and build strong cases.`,
