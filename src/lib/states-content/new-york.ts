  heroText: `New York's dense population, critical port infrastructure, and position as a national logistics hub make truck accidents particularly devastating and complex. With over 140 people killed annually in collisions involving large trucks, New York highways see serious commercial vehicle accidents regularly.

The New York trucking industry handles massive freight volumes. Over 220,000 commercial trucks are registered in the state, operating on corridors connecting the Port of New York and New Jersey—the busiest container port on the East Coast—to markets throughout the Northeast and beyond. The New York Thruway system (I-87/I-90) carries enormous freight volumes, while I-95 through the metropolitan area ranks among the busiest trucking routes in the nation.

Urban trucking in the New York metropolitan area presents unique hazards. Congested streets, complex highway interchanges, and tight delivery spaces create dangerous conditions. Upstate New York sees different challenges—long-haul freight on the Thruway, harsh winter conditions, and mountain grades through the Adirondacks and Catskills.

New York follows pure comparative negligence, meaning you can recover damages even if you were mostly at fault (though your recovery is reduced by your percentage of fault). This plaintiff-friendly rule allows truck accident victims to pursue claims even in contested fault situations.

If you've been injured in a New York truck accident, time matters. New York has a three-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims, but only two years for wrongful death. Our New York truck accident lawyers know how to preserve evidence, investigate thoroughly, and hold negligent carriers accountable.`,

  courtInfo: `Truck accident cases in New York may be filed in state Supreme Court (the trial-level court) or federal courts depending on the parties involved and amounts in controversy. Cases against trucking companies often involve defendants from multiple states, potentially qualifying for federal court under diversity jurisdiction if the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.

New York state courts follow the Civil Practice Law and Rules (CPLR), which include specific provisions for discovery that can be crucial in trucking cases. New York allows broad discovery of corporate defendants, including depositions of company representatives, production of safety records, and inspection of vehicles and maintenance facilities.

Venue in New York is governed by CPLR Article 5. Generally, cases may be filed where the accident occurred, where the defendant resides or has its principal office, or in certain counties where the defendant does business. New York City cases may be filed in any of the five borough Supreme Courts, while upstate venues vary by county.

The Southern and Eastern Districts of New York federal courts hear many trucking cases due to the volume of commercial activity in the metropolitan area. Federal judges in these districts are experienced with complex commercial transportation litigation.`,
