  heroText: `Alabama's position as a major freight corridor connecting the Southeast to the Gulf Coast creates significant commercial truck traffic on state highways. With over 140 people killed annually in collisions involving large trucks, Alabama roadways see devastating accidents regularly.

The Alabama trucking industry is substantial, with over 100,000 registered commercial trucks operating on corridors connecting Atlanta to Mobile, Nashville to the Gulf Coast, and carrying freight throughout the Southeast. I-65, I-20, I-10, and I-59 carry enormous freight volumes through the state.

The Port of Mobile adds significant truck traffic to Alabama highways, with container ships, bulk cargo, and automotive imports generating thousands of truck trips daily. Birmingham's position as an industrial center and Montgomery's role as the state capital further concentrate commercial traffic.

CRITICAL WARNING: Alabama is one of only four states that still follows contributory negligence. Under this harsh rule, if you are found even 1% at fault for the accident, you may be completely barred from recovering any damages. This makes Alabama one of the most challenging states for truck accident victims and makes experienced legal representation essential.

If you've been injured in an Alabama truck accident, time is critical. Alabama has a two-year statute of limitations, and proving you had zero fault requires immediate evidence preservation. Our Alabama truck accident lawyers know how to overcome the contributory negligence defense and hold negligent carriers accountable.`,

  courtInfo: `Truck accident cases in Alabama may be filed in state circuit courts or federal courts depending on the parties involved and amounts in controversy. Cases against trucking companies often involve defendants from multiple states, potentially qualifying for federal court under diversity jurisdiction if the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.

Alabama state courts follow the Alabama Rules of Civil Procedure, which include specific provisions for discovery that can be crucial in trucking cases. Alabama allows discovery of corporate defendants, including depositions of company representatives, production of safety records, and inspection of vehicles and maintenance facilities.

Venue rules in Alabama generally allow cases to be filed where the accident occurred, where the defendant resides or has its principal office, or where the plaintiff resides. Jefferson County (Birmingham) and Mobile County handle many truck accident cases due to the concentration of commercial traffic.

The Northern, Middle, and Southern Districts of Alabama federal courts hear trucking cases. Given Alabama's contributory negligence rule, forum selection can significantly impact case outcomes.`,

An Alabama truck accident lawyer also understands the state's trucking infrastructure, including the Port of Mobile operations, Birmingham industrial traffic, and the dangerous I-65 corridor.
