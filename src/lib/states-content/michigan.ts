  heroText: `Michigan's position as a critical link between the Midwest industrial heartland and international trade with Canada makes it one of the nation's most heavily trafficked trucking corridors. With over 150 people killed annually in collisions involving large trucks, Michigan roadways see devastating commercial vehicle accidents on a regular basis.

The Michigan trucking industry is substantial, with over 180,000 registered commercial trucks operating on the state's highways. Major corridors including I-94, I-75, I-96, and I-69 carry massive freight volumes between Detroit's automotive manufacturing centers, the Ambassador Bridge crossings to Canada, and distribution hubs throughout the Midwest.

The Ambassador Bridge and Detroit-Windsor Tunnel represent some of the busiest commercial border crossings in North America. More than 8,000 trucks cross the Ambassador Bridge daily, creating unique hazards on Michigan highways. International freight traffic, combined with domestic manufacturing shipments, makes Michigan's interstates particularly dangerous for passenger vehicles sharing the road with 18-wheelers.

Michigan law follows a modified comparative negligence rule with a 51% bar, meaning you can recover damages if you're not more than 50% at fault. The state's no-fault insurance system adds complexity to truck accident claims, though federal regulations often override state insurance requirements for interstate carriers.

If you've been injured in a Michigan truck accident, time is critical. Michigan has a three-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims, but trucking companies begin protecting their interests immediately after a crash. Our Michigan truck accident lawyers know how to preserve evidence, investigate thoroughly, and hold negligent carriers accountable.`,

    description: 'Michigan follows modified comparative negligence with a 51% bar. You can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, but recovery is barred if you are 51% or more at fault.',
    details: `Under Michigan's modified comparative negligence rule, your damages are reduced by your percentage of fault. If you are found 50% or less at fault, you can recover damages. However, if you are found 51% or more at fault, you recover nothing. For example, if you suffered $1,000,000 in damages and were 30% at fault, you could recover $700,000. But if a jury finds you 51% responsible, you recover nothing. This makes establishing the trucking company's greater fault critical in contested cases. Insurance adjusters often try to shift blame to victims to reduce or eliminate their responsibility—an experienced Michigan truck accident lawyer knows how to counter these tactics.`

This means you must file your lawsuit within three years of the accident date. Wrongful death claims also have a three-year deadline. Missing these deadlines typically bars your claim forever, so it's important to contact an attorney promptly after any serious truck accident. Evidence preservation is also time-sensitive—trucking companies may legally destroy certain records after required retention periods.`

  courtInfo: `Truck accident cases in Michigan may be filed in state circuit courts or federal courts depending on the parties involved and amounts in controversy. Cases against trucking companies often involve defendants from multiple states, potentially qualifying for federal court under diversity jurisdiction if the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.

Michigan state courts follow the Michigan Court Rules, which include specific provisions for discovery that can be crucial in trucking cases. Michigan allows discovery of corporate defendants, including depositions of company representatives, production of safety records, and inspection of vehicles and maintenance facilities.

Venue rules in Michigan generally allow cases to be filed where the accident occurred, where the defendant conducts business, or where the plaintiff resides. Wayne County (Detroit area) handles many truck accident cases due to the high volume of commercial traffic in the region. Choosing the right venue can significantly impact case outcomes, as different Michigan counties have varying jury pools and judicial tendencies.

Michigan's no-fault insurance system affects how claims are processed, but serious truck accidents typically qualify for tort claims against the at-fault trucking company outside the no-fault system.`,

  whyHireLocal: `Michigan truck accident cases require attorneys who understand both federal FMCSA regulations and the nuances of Michigan state law, including the complex no-fault insurance system. Local counsel knows the Michigan court system, local procedures, and the judges who will hear your case. They understand how Michigan juries evaluate trucking company negligence and what evidence resonates with local fact-finders.

Michigan's comparative negligence rules mean that fault allocation is critical to your recovery. Experienced local attorneys know how to minimize victim fault and maximize trucking company responsibility.

A Michigan truck accident lawyer also understands the state's unique trucking infrastructure, including the critical Canadian border crossings, automotive industry shipping patterns, and seasonal hazards on Michigan roads. They know the dangerous corridors, understand international trucking operations, and can investigate accidents involving carriers operating through Michigan's border crossings.

Finally, Michigan's no-fault insurance system adds complexity that out-of-state attorneys may not fully understand. A Michigan-licensed attorney ensures your case properly navigates both the no-fault system and traditional tort claims against negligent trucking companies.`,
