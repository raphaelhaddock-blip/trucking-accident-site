  heroText: `Louisiana's position at the mouth of the Mississippi River and along the Gulf Coast makes it one of the nation's most critical freight corridors. With over 100 people killed annually in collisions involving large trucks, Louisiana highways see devastating commercial vehicle accidents regularly.

The Louisiana trucking industry handles massive freight volumes. Over 85,000 commercial trucks are registered in the state, operating on corridors connecting the Port of Louisiana (the nation's largest port by tonnage), New Orleans, Baton Rouge, and the petrochemical corridor along the Mississippi River.

The chemical and petroleum industries create unique trucking hazards in Louisiana. Tanker trucks carrying hazardous materials travel Louisiana highways constantly, and accidents involving these vehicles can result in catastrophic injuries, explosions, and environmental damage.

Louisiana follows pure comparative negligence, allowing you to recover damages even if you were mostly at fault. However, LOUISIANA HAS THE SHORTEST STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS IN THE NATION—only one year for personal injury claims. This makes immediate legal action essential after any truck accident.

If you've been injured in a Louisiana truck accident, time is extremely critical. Our Louisiana truck accident lawyers know how to preserve evidence, investigate thoroughly, and hold negligent carriers accountable under both federal FMCSA regulations and Louisiana's unique civil law system.`,

    details: `Under Louisiana's pure comparative fault system (La. Civil Code Art. 2323), your damages are reduced by your percentage of fault, but you can still recover even if you were mostly at fault for the accident. For example, if you suffered $1,000,000 in damages but were 70% at fault, you could still recover $300,000. This is one of the most plaintiff-friendly systems in the nation, allowing truck accident victims to pursue claims even in contested fault situations. Insurance adjusters may try to exaggerate your fault to reduce their payout—an experienced Louisiana truck accident lawyer knows how to counter these tactics.`

  courtInfo: `Truck accident cases in Louisiana may be filed in state district courts or federal courts depending on the parties involved and amounts in controversy. Cases against trucking companies often involve defendants from multiple states, potentially qualifying for federal court under diversity jurisdiction if the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.

Louisiana state courts follow the Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure, which differs significantly from other states due to Louisiana's civil law tradition. Discovery procedures, pleading requirements, and trial procedures have unique aspects that attorneys must understand.

Venue rules in Louisiana generally allow cases to be filed where the accident occurred, where the defendant is domiciled, or in certain other parishes depending on the circumstances. Orleans Parish (New Orleans), East Baton Rouge Parish, and Caddo Parish (Shreveport) handle many truck accident cases.

The Eastern, Middle, and Western Districts of Louisiana federal courts hear trucking cases. Given Louisiana's unique civil law system and short statute of limitations, experienced Louisiana counsel is essential.`,

  whyHireLocal: `Louisiana truck accident cases require attorneys who understand both federal FMCSA regulations and Louisiana's unique civil law system. Louisiana is the only U.S. state based on the Napoleonic Code rather than English common law, creating distinct procedural and substantive rules that out-of-state attorneys may not understand.

Louisiana's one-year statute of limitations—the shortest in the nation—makes immediate action essential. Experienced Louisiana attorneys know how to move quickly to preserve evidence, send preservation letters, and protect your rights before the deadline passes.

Louisiana's pure comparative fault rules mean you can recover damages even if partially at fault—but experienced local attorneys know how to maximize trucking company responsibility and minimize victim fault allocation.

A Louisiana truck accident lawyer also understands the state's unique trucking infrastructure, including the massive port operations, petrochemical corridor hazards, and the challenges of navigating Louisiana's extensive waterways. This local knowledge helps build stronger cases and anticipate defenses specific to Louisiana trucking operations.`,
