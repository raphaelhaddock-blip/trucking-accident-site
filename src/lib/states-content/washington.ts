  heroText: `Washington's position as a major Pacific gateway creates significant commercial truck traffic throughout the state. With over 70 people killed annually in collisions involving large trucks, Washington highways see devastating accidents regularly.

The Washington trucking industry handles massive freight volumes. Over 95,000 commercial trucks are registered in the state, operating on corridors connecting the Port of Seattle and Port of Tacoma to inland markets, carrying freight along I-5 from Canada to Oregon, and crossing the Cascade Mountains on I-90.

The Seattle-Tacoma port complex is a major Pacific gateway, generating enormous truck traffic. I-5 through the Seattle metropolitan area is one of the most congested trucking corridors on the West Coast, while I-90 over Snoqualmie Pass presents mountain challenges including steep grades and winter weather.

Washington follows pure comparative negligence, allowing you to recover damages even if you were mostly at fault. The state has a three-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims.

If you've been injured in a Washington truck accident, our Washington truck accident lawyers know how to preserve evidence, investigate thoroughly, and hold negligent carriers accountable.`,

  courtInfo: `Truck accident cases in Washington may be filed in state superior courts or federal courts depending on the parties involved and amounts in controversy. Cases against trucking companies often involve defendants from multiple states, potentially qualifying for federal court under diversity jurisdiction if the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.

Washington state courts follow the Washington Court Rules. Washington allows discovery of corporate defendants, including depositions of company representatives, production of safety records, and inspection of vehicles and maintenance facilities.

Venue rules in Washington generally allow cases to be filed where the accident occurred, where the defendant resides or has its principal office, or where the plaintiff resides. King County (Seattle), Pierce County (Tacoma), and Spokane County handle many truck accident cases.

The Western and Eastern Districts of Washington federal courts handle trucking cases involving out-of-state defendants.`,
