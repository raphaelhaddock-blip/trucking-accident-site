  heroText: `Maryland's position along the critical I-95 corridor and its role as home to the Port of Baltimore creates intense commercial truck traffic on state highways. With over 60 people killed annually in collisions involving large trucks, Maryland roadways see devastating accidents regularly.

The Maryland trucking industry handles substantial freight volumes. Over 85,000 commercial trucks are registered in the state, operating on I-95 (one of the busiest trucking routes on the East Coast), I-70, I-83, and the Capital Beltway around Washington, D.C.

The Port of Baltimore is the nation's top port for automobile imports, generating enormous truck traffic. The congested Baltimore and Washington metropolitan areas create particularly hazardous conditions as commercial trucks mix with heavy commuter traffic.

CRITICAL WARNING: Maryland is one of only four states that still follows contributory negligence. Under this harsh rule, if you are found even 1% at fault for the accident, you may be completely barred from recovering any damages. This makes Maryland one of the most challenging states for truck accident victims.

If you've been injured in a Maryland truck accident, time is critical. Maryland has a three-year statute of limitations, but proving you had zero fault requires immediate evidence preservation.`,

    details: `Maryland is one of only a few states that still follows the harsh contributory negligence rule. Under this rule, if you are found even 1% at fault for the accident, you may be completely barred from recovering any damages. This makes Maryland one of the most challenging states for truck accident victims. However, there are exceptions—such as when the defendant's conduct was willful or wanton, or when the last clear chance doctrine applies. Because of this harsh rule, trucking companies and their insurers aggressively try to find any evidence of victim fault. An experienced Maryland truck accident lawyer understands how to overcome these defenses and prove the trucking company's sole responsibility.`

  courtInfo: `Truck accident cases in Maryland may be filed in state circuit courts or federal courts depending on the parties involved and amounts in controversy. Cases against trucking companies often involve defendants from multiple states, potentially qualifying for federal court under diversity jurisdiction if the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.

Maryland state courts follow the Maryland Rules. Maryland allows discovery of corporate defendants, including depositions of company representatives, production of safety records, and inspection of vehicles and maintenance facilities.

Venue rules in Maryland generally allow cases to be filed where the accident occurred, where the defendant resides or has its principal office, or where the plaintiff resides. Baltimore City, Baltimore County, and Prince George's County handle many truck accident cases.

The District of Maryland federal court, with locations in Baltimore and Greenbelt, handles trucking cases involving out-of-state defendants. Given Maryland's contributory negligence rule, forum selection can significantly impact case outcomes.`,

  whyHireLocal: `Maryland truck accident cases require attorneys who understand both federal FMCSA regulations and the critical nuances of Maryland's contributory negligence rule. Local counsel knows how to overcome this harsh defense and prove the trucking company was entirely at fault.

Maryland's contributory negligence rule presents unique challenges. Because even 1% fault can bar recovery, it's essential to work with attorneys who know how to overcome this defense and prove the trucking company's sole responsibility. Experienced Maryland attorneys understand the exceptions and know how to present cases to avoid the contributory negligence bar.

A Maryland truck accident lawyer also understands the state's trucking infrastructure, including the Port of Baltimore operations, the congested I-95 corridor, and the Capital Beltway challenges. They know how Maryland juries evaluate trucking company negligence and what evidence resonates with local fact-finders.`,
