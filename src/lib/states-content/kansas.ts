  heroText: `Kansas's position as a central crossroads of America's interstate system creates significant commercial truck traffic across the state. With over 60 people killed annually in collisions involving large trucks, Kansas highways see devastating accidents despite its relatively low population.

The Kansas trucking industry handles critical freight flows. Over 70,000 commercial trucks are registered in the state, operating on I-70 (a primary cross-country route), I-35 (the NAFTA highway), and corridors connecting Kansas City to Denver, Oklahoma City, and markets throughout the heartland.

Kansas's agricultural economy generates substantial truck traffic. Grain transport during harvest season, livestock hauling, and farm equipment create unique hazards on Kansas highways. The state's position in "Tornado Alley" adds weather-related dangers to trucking operations.

Kansas follows modified comparative negligence with a 50% bar, meaning you can recover damages if you are 50% or less at fault, but recovery is barred if you are more than 50% at fault. The state has a two-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims.

If you've been injured in a Kansas truck accident, our Kansas truck accident lawyers know how to preserve evidence, investigate thoroughly, and hold negligent carriers accountable.`,

  courtInfo: `Truck accident cases in Kansas may be filed in state district courts or federal courts depending on the parties involved and amounts in controversy. Cases against trucking companies often involve defendants from multiple states, potentially qualifying for federal court under diversity jurisdiction if the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.

Kansas state courts follow the Kansas Code of Civil Procedure. Kansas allows discovery of corporate defendants, including depositions of company representatives, production of safety records, and inspection of vehicles and maintenance facilities.

Venue rules in Kansas generally allow cases to be filed where the accident occurred, where the defendant resides or has its principal office, or where the plaintiff resides. Johnson County (Kansas City suburbs), Sedgwick County (Wichita), and Shawnee County (Topeka) handle many truck accident cases.

The District of Kansas federal court handles trucking cases involving out-of-state defendants.`,
